Plant quarantine pests are invasive alien pests that are capable of causing economic damage to agricultural crops or forest trees. These pests, which are classified as either absent or of restricted distribution in Canada, are controlled by the application of specific regulations aimed at preventing their artificial spread by human means (FAO 1999).

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada’s Land Base Resources
Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2). Damage resulting from past introductions of harmful invasive plant pests is currently estimated to be $7.3 billion annually (Table 1). Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Agriculture
A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species. Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa Kühn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe). Golden nematode is a major pest of potatoes in cool-temperate regions; it attacks the roots of the potato plants, causing thefoliage to yellow, wilt, and die. The oriental fruit moth…

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada’s Land Base Resources
Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2).

It is concluded that the medical importance of fire ants in the USA has been greatly exaggerated, that their impact on agroecosystems is far from altogether harmful, and that in the 26 years since the USDA began to attempt their eradication with chemical insecticides (chiefly mirex) at a total cost of some $200 million the problem is worse than ever.

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species.

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.","EN",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Authorities-Stakeholders","Damage_costs","no","Country","V2-1",260714039.93606,0.26071403993606,NA,17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,2.81741,1833390960.46054,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.","EN",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Authorities-Stakeholders","Mixed_costs","no","Country","V2-1",1275107968.24623,1.27510796824623,"EUR",17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,2.81741,30819485.2218508,0.614053343002483,4,246,"Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771)",11900,"1986","freshwater","present","introduced","","FirstRecords; GRIIS","CABI ISC","","Invasive","1986"

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.","EN",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Mixed","Mixed_costs","no","Country","V2-1",56924462.8681353,0.0569244628681353,"Diverse",17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,2.81741,30819485.2218508,0.614053343002483,4,246,"Lythrum salicaria L.",28401,"","freshwater; terrestrial","","introduced","","GloNAF; GRIIS","","","",""

There was no relationship between resources invested in management and management success, and those organizations that endorsed a particular objective were no more likely to achieve it. Our results question the efficacy of current P. australis management strategies and call for future monitoring of biological management outcomes.","EN",NA,NA,2005,2009,"Authorities-Stakeholders","Management_costs","no","Country","V2-1",968032.452329384,0.000968032452329384,NA,17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,2.81741,59206697.1169905,0.799099124407257,7,246,"Phragmites australis (Cav.)

resulting in substantial mortality in coastal live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and several other related tree
species on the Pacific Coast of the United States. We estimate the discounted cost of oak treatment,
removal, and replacement on developed land in California communities using simulations of P. ramorum
spread and infection risk over the next decade (2010e2020). An estimated 734 thousand oak trees occur
on developed land in communities in the analysis area. The simulations predict an expanding sudden oak
death (SOD) infestation that will likely encompass most of northwestern California and warrant treatment,
removal, and replacement of more than 10 thousand oak trees with discounted cost of $7.5 million.
In addition, we estimate the discounted property losses to single family homes of $135 million.
Expanding the land base to include developed land outside as well as inside communities doubles the
estimates of the number of oak trees killed and the associated costs and losses. The predicted costs and
property value losses are substantial, but many of the damages in urban areas (e.g. potential losses from
increased fire and safety risks of the dead trees and the loss of ecosystem service values) are not
included.","EN",NA,NA,2008,2008,"Authorities-Stakeholders","Management_costs","no","Country","V2-1",11384892.5736271,0.0113848925736271,NA,17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,2.81741,9462403.96504656,1,1,246,"Phytophthora ramorum Werres, De Cock & Man",13537,"1995","endoparasitic","present","introduced","","FirstRecords; GRIIS","Aukema et al.
