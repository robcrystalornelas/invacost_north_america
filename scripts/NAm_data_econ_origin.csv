Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa K√ºhn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe).

International actions to reduce the spread and damage of all invasive species are currently being undertaken under the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity to which Canada is a party. Plant quarantine pests are invasive alien pests that are capable of causing economic damage to agricultural crops or forest trees. These pests, which are classified as either absent or of restricted distribution in Canada, are controlled by the application of specific regulations aimed at preventing their artificial spread by human means (FAO 1999). Included in the classification are insects, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses, and weeds; to date, weeds have not been subjected to quarantine actions.

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada‚Äôs Land Base Resources
Each year Canada‚Äôs agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2). Damage resulting from past introductions of harmful invasive plant pests is currently estimated to be $7.3 billion annually (Table 1). Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Plant quarantine pests are invasive alien pests that are capable of causing economic damage to agricultural crops or forest trees. These pests, which are classified as either absent or of restricted distribution in Canada, are controlled by the application of specific regulations aimed at preventing their artificial spread by human means (FAO 1999). Included in the classification are insects, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses, and weeds; to date, weeds have not been subjected to quarantine actions.

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada‚Äôs Land Base Resources
Each year Canada‚Äôs agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2). Damage resulting from past introductions of harmful invasive plant pests is currently estimated to be $7.3 billion annually (Table 1). Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Agriculture
A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species. Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa K√ºhn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe).

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species.

It is concluded that the medical importance of fire ants in the USA has been greatly exaggerated, that their impact on agroecosystems is far from altogether harmful, and that in the 26 years since the USDA began to attempt their eradication with chemical insecticides (chiefly mirex) at a total cost of some $200 million the problem is worse than ever. Finally, it is suggested that the reasons why these insects became an official target for eradication in the first place were not scientific or even economic, but largely political.","EN",NA,NA,1963,1989,"Unspecified","Mixed_costs","Country",14646684,0.014646684,NA,17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,NA,2561996065.76912,1,NA

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.","EN",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Mixed","Damage_costs","Country",6865090222,6.865090222,NA,17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,NA,2561996065.76912,1,NA

effects on fish and invertebrate fauna, toxic effects on
other biota, and habitat change were also identified. The
mechanisms underlying the manifestation of impacts are
uncertain and inferences about common patterns were
hampered because impact studies were available for only
a few introduced seaweeds, covered only a fraction of
their introduced distribution and generally were conducted
over short time scales. There was no information
about evolutionary effects or changes of ecosystem
processes. Knowledge of socio-economic impacts of
invasive seaweeds is poor. We collated costs associated
with control/eradication activities and for national spending
on marine biosecurity in Australia, New Zealand and
the United States. Prevention of impacts is the driving
force for costly surveillance, eradication and control programs.

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.","EN",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Mixed","Mixed_costs","Country",138895689,0.138895689,NA,17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,NA,2561996065.76912,1,NA

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.","EN",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Agriculture","Damage_costs","Country",24135972,0.024135972,NA,17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,NA,2561996065.76912,1,NA

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.","EN",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Authorities-Stakeholders","Damage_costs","Country",260714040,0.26071404,NA,17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,NA,2561996065.76912,1,NA

This study evaluates the economic impacts of tamarisk (Tamarix sp.), an invasive woody shrub, on societally-valued ecosystem services in its naturalized range. Tamarisk, intentionally introduced from Eurasia, has invaded most riparian areas of the arid and semiarid western United States. In its naturalized range, tamarisk consumes more water than native vegetation, with significant economic implications in a region marked by water scarcity. Tamarisk also increases sedimentation in river channels, leading to increased frequency and severity of flood damage. Conservative economic estimates of these impacts indicate that the annual costs of tamarisk to the western United States total USD 280–450 ha–1. Eradicating the invader and restoring native riparian communities throughout the region would cost approximately USD 7400 ha–1. Full recovery of these costs, even with a highly conservative benefits estimate, would occur in as few as 17 years, after which the societal, ecological, and economic benefits of restoration would continue to accrue indefinitely.","EN",NA,NA,1998,2018,"Mixed","Damage_costs","Country",314278368,0.314278368,NA,17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,NA,236560099.126164,1,NA

removal, and replacement on developed land in California communities using simulations of P. ramorum
spread and infection risk over the next decade (2010e2020). An estimated 734 thousand oak trees occur
on developed land in communities in the analysis area. The simulations predict an expanding sudden oak
death (SOD) infestation that will likely encompass most of northwestern California and warrant treatment,
removal, and replacement of more than 10 thousand oak trees with discounted cost of $7.5 million.
In addition, we estimate the discounted property losses to single family homes of $135 million.
Expanding the land base to include developed land outside as well as inside communities doubles the
estimates of the number of oak trees killed and the associated costs and losses. The predicted costs and
property value losses are substantial, but many of the damages in urban areas (e.g. potential losses from
increased fire and safety risks of the dead trees and the loss of ecosystem service values) are not

This study evaluates the economic impacts of tamarisk (Tamarix sp.), an invasive woody shrub, on societally-valued ecosystem services in its naturalized range. Tamarisk, intentionally introduced from Eurasia, has invaded most riparian areas of the arid and semiarid western United States. In its naturalized range, tamarisk consumes more water than native vegetation, with significant economic implications in a region marked by water scarcity. Tamarisk also increases sedimentation in river channels, leading to increased frequency and severity of flood damage. Conservative economic estimates of these impacts indicate that the annual costs of tamarisk to the western United States total USD 280–450 ha–1. Eradicating the invader and restoring native riparian communities throughout the region would cost approximately USD 7400 ha–1. Full recovery of these costs, even with a highly conservative benefits estimate, would occur in as few as 17 years, after which the societal, ecological, and economic benefits of restoration would continue to accrue indefinitely.","EN",NA,NA,1998,2018,"Mixed","Damage_costs","Country",314278368,0.314278368,NA,17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,NA,236560099.126164,1,NA

We found that from 2005 to 2009, these organizations spent >$4.6 million per year on P. australis management, and that 94 % used herbicide to treat a total area of ?80,000 ha. Despite these high expenditures, few organizations accomplished their management objectives. There was no relationship between resources invested in management and management success, and those organizations that endorsed a particular objective were no more likely to achieve it.

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.","EN",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Authorities-Stakeholders","Mixed_costs","Country",1275107968,1.275107968,"EUR",17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,NA,30819485.2218508,0.614053343002483,3

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.","EN",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Mixed","Mixed_costs","Country",56924463,0.056924463,"Diverse",17.1,1.7858e+11,17348626599470.8,NA,40281889.1868974,0.704714015855375,3

This study evaluates the economic impacts of tamarisk (Tamarix sp.), an invasive woody shrub, on societally-valued ecosystem services in its naturalized range. Tamarisk, intentionally introduced from Eurasia, has invaded most riparian areas of the arid and semiarid western United States. In its naturalized range, tamarisk consumes more water than native vegetation, with significant economic implications in a region marked by water scarcity. Tamarisk also increases sedimentation in river channels, leading to increased frequency and severity of flood damage. Conservative economic estimates of these impacts indicate that the annual costs of tamarisk to the western United States total USD 280–450 ha–1. Eradicating the invader and restoring native riparian communities throughout the region would cost approximately USD 7400 ha–1.
