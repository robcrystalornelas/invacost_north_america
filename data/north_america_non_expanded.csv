In 2010 the presence of citrus greening or Huanglonbing (HLB), a disease affecting, was detected in this region and has since translated into multiplying losses. Up to this date, no cure for it is known and the low profitability of the production forces growers to withdraw their crops. Therefore, the productive reconversion modifies the produc- tion pattern by establishing alternate crops with a higher agronomic and social feasibility, as well as a better economic profitability. The main goal of this research was to quantify the changes in the crops and to assess the potential of introducing new ones. In order to monitor, identify and quantify such changes, satellite imagery analysis, building and analysis of agricultural databases, on site measure- ments and interviews were conducted. An increasing number of crops were substituted, close to 5,000 ha of citrus have been replaced, which amounts to a reduction of 84,721 tons in the production of Mexican lemon and a loss of $302, 636,729 MXN, approximately. The area of emergent crops such as papaya and pineapple keeps increasing and has represented a higher income for producers.","SP",NA,NA,2010,2014,"Agriculture","Damage_costs","no","Site","V2"

Populations of gypsy moth increase periodically to very high local densities and severely defoliate preferred host trees (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990). In its native range, gypsy moth displays highly variable biological characteristics. The most significant life-history variations relevant to invasiveness are the geographic differences in flight capability of adult females and host food range of the larvae. Female moths from western (European) populations are flightless, while those from eastern (Asian) populations are capable of strong, directed flight. Gypsy moth larvae feed on a wide variety of mostly broadleaf tree hosts throughout their geographic range, but Asian populations also feed on coniferous tree species and therefore are of even greater concern to Canada than the European populations.
A European strain of the gypsy moth escaped from a laboratory near Boston, MA, in 1869. Since then, gypsy moth has spread and become established in the temperate forests of eastern North America, approximately between latitudes 36° and 47°N, and from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes basin as far as 90°W. During this same period, there have been repeated interceptions of both European and Asian strains of gypsy moth in western North America but, as yet (2000), neither strain is regarded as established there.
The North American experience with gypsy moth is an instructive case study of an invasive spe cies. There has been a well-documented public and scientific response to the problems caused by gypsy moth that can serve as a historical lesson for managing local and national environments in the global village. Scientific information on gypsy moth is probably as thorough as that on any invasive forest insect. Public policy on managing gypsy moth has ranged from neglect to aggressive mitigative action at considerable public cost and sometimes with dire environmental conse quences.
We can compare actions in the United States and Canada from distinct historical and legislative perspectives. As a case study in Canada, we can examine the impacts of establishment and spread of this alien species in eastern Canada and analyze the feasibility and benefits of maintaining gypsy moth-free regions by coordinating national and regional management activities. Discussion here emphasizes history and status of the European strain of gypsy moth now widely established in eastern North America and threatening to extend its range. Regulatory agencies now refer to this European strain as the North American gypsy moth, although it remains an alien species. Issues discussed here, however, pertain equally to the Asian strain of gypsy moth.
Attributes of an Invader
The gypsy moth has several biological and ecological attributes that favor its success as an invasive
species. Gypsy moth has a broad native geographic range that presents many potential sources of introduction. Also, the insect tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and feeds on many different tree species. Thus gypsy moth has a high probability of persistence in temperate forests worldwide. The reproductive biology of gypsy moth also favors colonization. Adult females may produce more than 1000 offspring in a single egg mass, so even one female can contribute a sizable founding population.
The greatest limitation of gypsy moth as an invasive species is that it is a poor disperser over long distances. The female adult moth of the European strain is flightless. Natural dispersal is restricted to relatively short distance ballooning of newly hatched larvae (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990), making gypsy moth’s surreptitious association with humans significant. Many of the host plants that gypsy moth favors flourish in habitats associated with human settlement. Further, gypsy moths frequently leave their host plants to lay eggs in sheltered locations and these are often structures associated with humans, such as firewood and outdoor household goods. When these goods are moved, the gypsy moth moves with them. Thus, although some spread of gypsy moth along the margins of its range in North America can be accounted for by natural dispersal of small larvae, inadvertent movement of egg masses, by a mobile human population, is the source of most new infestations in areas remote from the established populations, particularly those in western North America.

It took more than 25 years of research and development to bring Bt from first experimental use in the early 1960s into full operational use in the mid 1980s. Critical to this process was the adoption of HD-1 for commercial use, the standardization of formulations based on international units, and the development of higher potency products. An increase in product potency from 4 BIU/L in the early 1970s to 16.9 BIU/L in the mid 1980s, concomittant with improvements in formulation and application technology, reduced treatment costs while at the same time improving reliability of efficacy. A shift in political climate pushed Bt into operational use by 1985. Since then, Bt has been used in more than half of all spruce budworm control programs. The use of high-potency formulations (12.7 to 16.9 BIU/L) applied undiluted at 30 BIU in 2.4 L/ha or less has significantly reduced but not eliminated initial constraints of high treatment costs and inconsistent efficacy. Current research is focussed on further reducing these constraints. In the short term, registration of formulations containing 25 BIU/L or more is expected to permit application of reduced dosages in less than 1 L/ha and to clear the way for adoption of a split application scheme to increase reliability of efficacy. Selection and commercialization of more effective strains and the enhancement of natural strains by genetic or genetic engineering techniques offer exciting prospects for improvements in the longer term.","EN",NA,NA,1988,1988,"Authorities-Stakeholders","Management_costs","no","Unit","V2-1"

Populations of gypsy moth increase periodically to very high local densities and severely defoliate preferred host trees (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990). In its native range, gypsy moth displays highly variable biological characteristics. The most significant life-history variations relevant to invasiveness are the geographic differences in flight capability of adult females and host food range of the larvae. Female moths from western (European) populations are flightless, while those from eastern (Asian) populations are capable of strong, directed flight. Gypsy moth larvae feed on a wide variety of mostly broadleaf tree hosts throughout their geographic range, but Asian populations also feed on coniferous tree species and therefore are of even greater concern to Canada than the European populations.
A European strain of the gypsy moth escaped from a laboratory near Boston, MA, in 1869. Since then, gypsy moth has spread and become established in the temperate forests of eastern North America, approximately between latitudes 36° and 47°N, and from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes basin as far as 90°W. During this same period, there have been repeated interceptions of both European and Asian strains of gypsy moth in western North America but, as yet (2000), neither strain is regarded as established there.
The North American experience with gypsy moth is an instructive case study of an invasive spe cies. There has been a well-documented public and scientific response to the problems caused by gypsy moth that can serve as a historical lesson for managing local and national environments in the global village. Scientific information on gypsy moth is probably as thorough as that on any invasive forest insect. Public policy on managing gypsy moth has ranged from neglect to aggressive mitigative action at considerable public cost and sometimes with dire environmental conse quences.
We can compare actions in the United States and Canada from distinct historical and legislative perspectives. As a case study in Canada, we can examine the impacts of establishment and spread of this alien species in eastern Canada and analyze the feasibility and benefits of maintaining gypsy moth-free regions by coordinating national and regional management activities. Discussion here emphasizes history and status of the European strain of gypsy moth now widely established in eastern North America and threatening to extend its range. Regulatory agencies now refer to this European strain as the North American gypsy moth, although it remains an alien species. Issues discussed here, however, pertain equally to the Asian strain of gypsy moth.
Attributes of an Invader
The gypsy moth has several biological and ecological attributes that favor its success as an invasive
species. Gypsy moth has a broad native geographic range that presents many potential sources of introduction. Also, the insect tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and feeds on many different tree species. Thus gypsy moth has a high probability of persistence in temperate forests worldwide. The reproductive biology of gypsy moth also favors colonization. Adult females may produce more than 1000 offspring in a single egg mass, so even one female can contribute a sizable founding population.
The greatest limitation of gypsy moth as an invasive species is that it is a poor disperser over long distances. The female adult moth of the European strain is flightless. Natural dispersal is restricted to relatively short distance ballooning of newly hatched larvae (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990), making gypsy moth’s surreptitious association with humans significant. Many of the host plants that gypsy moth favors flourish in habitats associated with human settlement. Further, gypsy moths frequently leave their host plants to lay eggs in sheltered locations and these are often structures associated with humans, such as firewood and outdoor household goods. When these goods are moved, the gypsy moth moves with them. Thus, although some spread of gypsy moth along the margins of its range in North America can be accounted for by natural dispersal of small larvae, inadvertent movement of egg masses, by a mobile human population, is the source of most new infestations in areas remote from the established populations, particularly those in western North America.

During this same period, there have been repeated interceptions of both European and Asian strains of gypsy moth in western North America but, as yet (2000), neither strain is regarded as established there.
The North American experience with gypsy moth is an instructive case study of an invasive spe cies. There has been a well-documented public and scientific response to the problems caused by gypsy moth that can serve as a historical lesson for managing local and national environments in the global village. Scientific information on gypsy moth is probably as thorough as that on any invasive forest insect. Public policy on managing gypsy moth has ranged from neglect to aggressive mitigative action at considerable public cost and sometimes with dire environmental conse quences.
We can compare actions in the United States and Canada from distinct historical and legislative perspectives. As a case study in Canada, we can examine the impacts of establishment and spread of this alien species in eastern Canada and analyze the feasibility and benefits of maintaining gypsy moth-free regions by coordinating national and regional management activities. Discussion here emphasizes history and status of the European strain of gypsy moth now widely established in eastern North America and threatening to extend its range. Regulatory agencies now refer to this European strain as the North American gypsy moth, although it remains an alien species. Issues discussed here, however, pertain equally to the Asian strain of gypsy moth.
Attributes of an Invader
The gypsy moth has several biological and ecological attributes that favor its success as an invasive
species. Gypsy moth has a broad native geographic range that presents many potential sources of introduction. Also, the insect tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and feeds on many different tree species. Thus gypsy moth has a high probability of persistence in temperate forests worldwide. The reproductive biology of gypsy moth also favors colonization. Adult females may produce more than 1000 offspring in a single egg mass, so even one female can contribute a sizable founding population.
The greatest limitation of gypsy moth as an invasive species is that it is a poor disperser over long distances. The female adult moth of the European strain is flightless. Natural dispersal is restricted to relatively short distance ballooning of newly hatched larvae (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990), making gypsy moth’s surreptitious association with humans significant. Many of the host plants that gypsy moth favors flourish in habitats associated with human settlement. Further, gypsy moths frequently leave their host plants to lay eggs in sheltered locations and these are often structures associated with humans, such as firewood and outdoor household goods. When these goods are moved, the gypsy moth moves with them. Thus, although some spread of gypsy moth along the margins of its range in North America can be accounted for by natural dispersal of small larvae, inadvertent movement of egg masses, by a mobile human population, is the source of most new infestations in areas remote from the established populations, particularly those in western North America.

Populations of gypsy moth increase periodically to very high local densities and severely defoliate preferred host trees (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990). In its native range, gypsy moth displays highly variable biological characteristics. The most significant life-history variations relevant to invasiveness are the geographic differences in flight capability of adult females and host food range of the larvae. Female moths from western (European) populations are flightless, while those from eastern (Asian) populations are capable of strong, directed flight. Gypsy moth larvae feed on a wide variety of mostly broadleaf tree hosts throughout their geographic range, but Asian populations also feed on coniferous tree species and therefore are of even greater concern to Canada than the European populations.

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.","EN",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Authorities-Stakeholders","Damage_costs","no","Unit","V2-1"

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada’s Land Base Resources
Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs.

A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species.

Plant quarantine pests are invasive alien pests that are capable of causing economic damage to agricultural crops or forest trees. These pests, which are classified as either absent or of restricted distribution in Canada, are controlled by the application of specific regulations aimed at preventing their artificial spread by human means (FAO 1999). Included in the classification are insects, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses, and weeds; to date, weeds have not been subjected to quarantine actions.

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada’s Land Base Resources
Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2). Damage resulting from past introductions of harmful invasive plant pests is currently estimated to be $7.3 billion annually (Table 1). Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Agriculture
A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species. Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa Kühn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe). Golden nematode is a major pest of potatoes in cool-temperate regions; it attacks the roots of the potato plants, causing thefoliage to yellow, wilt, and die. The oriental fruit moth…
