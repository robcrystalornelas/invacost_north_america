Up to this date, no cure for it is known and the low profitability of the production forces growers to withdraw their crops. Therefore, the productive reconversion modifies the produc- tion pattern by establishing alternate crops with a higher agronomic and social feasibility, as well as a better economic profitability. The main goal of this research was to quantify the changes in the crops and to assess the potential of introducing new ones. In order to monitor, identify and quantify such changes, satellite imagery analysis, building and analysis of agricultural databases, on site measure- ments and interviews were conducted. An increasing number of crops were substituted, close to 5,000 ha of citrus have been replaced, which amounts to a reduction of 84,721 tons in the production of Mexican lemon and a loss of $302, 636,729 MXN, approximately.

in the absence of formal rapid response plans. Even so, many of the essential elements of a rapid response plan were in fact
implemented in the management of recent invasions of the non-indigenous tunicates Styela clava, Botryllus schlosseri,
Botrylloides violaceus, and Ciona intestinalis in estuaries of Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. In this second of a three-part

Labor is the most expensive portion of a weed management project. It is incumbent upon land managers to use methods that minimize labor costs, and this is especially so with public land managers because they are dependent upon tax dollars to execute their programs. Using herbicides and biological control agents to decrease the population abundance of a target invasive weed are approaches that utilize the least labor to affect initial and continued reduction of the target species. Because biocontrol is developed using public funds, it seems inexpensive to the end user, which includes federal agencies. Biocontrol is a very attractive and highly useful approach to control invasive weed species, however, success has been inconsistent in space and time. There are numerous successful biocontrol endeavors and the literature offers many examples. The USDA Forest Service’s Fire Effects Information System website (www. fs.fed.us/database/feis/) is one of the best and most complete information sources for the biology and management of many invasive weed species. Another outstanding source of information on managing invasive weeds which recently became available is Weed Control in Natural Areas in the Western United States (Joseph DiTomaso et al., 2013: University of California Weed Research and Information Center). It too describes where and upon what species biocontrol has been successful and extensively outlines all management options. If biocontrol is the method selected, land managers must carefully research choices for their effectiveness. The spatial and temporal variation associated with biocontrol performance may be due to many genetic and environmental reasons—from habitat preference by the biocontrol agent to the production of new genotypes from previously geographically separated genotypes now growing in proximity to one another, and many as yet to be discovered reasons. Fire too can be a good tool to decrease populations (DiTomaso et al. 2006) of some invasive weeds, most notably annual grasses and forbs such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). As with other integrated management systems for weeds, the use of fire to manage invasive weeds must be integrated with other tools, such as seeding, to provide competition to ward off recovering weed species and allow for completion of land management goals and objectives. Burning mixed brush-cheatgrass stands destroys some to many weed seeds and allows about one season of desirable vegetation to establish before cheatgrass re-establishes and dominates the site again (Evans and Young 1978; Young and Evans 1978; Young 2000). Establishing competitive perennial grass species may successfully keep cheatgrass from re-establishing. If, however, the system is left alone after burning, cheatgrass or medusahead will re-invade. Burning stands of yellow starthistle also can provide excellent population control if combined with herbicide treatment and seeding (DiTomaso et al. 2006b). Burning stands of a perennial weed, such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) and other knapweeds, or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), is rarely effective because of the plants’ ability to re-grow from its root system and dominate a site again. These and other similar invasive weeds may recover soon enough after a prescribed burn to preclude establishment of seeded species. If fire is used to control perennial forbs or grasses, herbicides will likely have to be integrated into the management system to allow sufficient suppression of the target weed for a long enough time to",2009,English,Slideshow presentation,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Asteraceae,Centaurea,Centaurea affinis/Centaurea stoebe,,spotted knapweed,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,NA,4,N,North America,USA,Diverse/Unspecified,Unspecified,Unit (100 square feet),Unspecified,Year,Unspecified,Unspecified,2009,2009,Potentially ongoing,2,2.03,6,2.29,2.29,2,2.29,2.29,USD,2009,Publication year,Potential,Extrapolation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Control,Management_costs,Post-invasion_management,Low,,,,,no,"Table 1.

SC22,,Tumber2014,Pierce’s disease costs California $104 million per year.,Tumber et al.,"Pierce’s disease of grapevines, caused by a strain of the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa, threatens an industry with a farm value of production exceeding $3 billion per year. The grape industry incurs substantial costs from losses of vines to the disease and efforts to mitigate damage.

SC31,,Beck2009,"Economics of Invasive Weed Control: Chemical, Manual/Physical/Fire, Biological, and Doing Nothing",Beck,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] Financial Costs Per Acre and Impacts to Budgets Regardless of whether working for private enterprise or government, land management personnel must stretch limited budgets yet be effective simultaneously. Labor is the most expensive portion of a weed management project. It is incumbent upon land managers to use methods that minimize labor costs, and this is especially so with public land managers because they are dependent upon tax dollars to execute their programs. Using herbicides and biological control agents to decrease the population abundance of a target invasive weed are approaches that utilize the least labor to affect initial and continued reduction of the target species. Because biocontrol is developed using public funds, it seems inexpensive to the end user, which includes federal agencies. Biocontrol is a very attractive and highly useful approach to control invasive weed species, however, success has been inconsistent in space and time. There are numerous successful biocontrol endeavors and the literature offers many examples. The USDA Forest Service’s Fire Effects Information System website (www. fs.fed.us/database/feis/) is one of the best and most complete information sources for the biology and management of many invasive weed species. Another outstanding source of information on managing invasive weeds which recently became available is Weed Control in Natural Areas in the Western United States (Joseph DiTomaso et al., 2013: University of California Weed Research and Information Center). It too describes where and upon what species biocontrol has been successful and extensively outlines all management options. If biocontrol is the method selected, land managers must carefully research choices for their effectiveness. The spatial and temporal variation associated with biocontrol performance may be due to many genetic and environmental reasons—from habitat preference by the biocontrol agent to the production of new genotypes from previously geographically separated genotypes now growing in proximity to one another, and many as yet to be discovered reasons. Fire too can be a good tool to decrease populations (DiTomaso et al. 2006) of some invasive weeds, most notably annual grasses and forbs such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). As with other integrated management systems for weeds, the use of fire to manage invasive weeds must be integrated with other tools, such as seeding, to provide competition to ward off recovering weed species and allow for completion of land management goals and objectives. Burning mixed brush-cheatgrass stands destroys some to many weed seeds and allows about one season of desirable vegetation to establish before cheatgrass re-establishes and dominates the site again (Evans and Young 1978; Young and Evans 1978; Young 2000). Establishing competitive perennial grass species may successfully keep cheatgrass from re-establishing. If, however, the system is left alone after burning, cheatgrass or medusahead will re-invade. Burning stands of yellow starthistle also can provide excellent population control if combined with herbicide treatment and seeding (DiTomaso et al. 2006b). Burning stands of a perennial weed, such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) and other knapweeds, or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), is rarely effective because of the plants’ ability to re-grow from its root system and dominate a site again. These and other similar invasive weeds may recover soon enough after a prescribed burn to preclude establishment of seeded species. If fire is used to control perennial forbs or grasses, herbicides will likely have to be integrated into the management system to allow sufficient suppression of the target weed for a long enough time to",2009,English,Slideshow presentation,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Asteraceae,Centaurea,Centaurea affinis/Centaurea stoebe,,spotted knapweed,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,NA,4,N,North America,USA,Diverse/Unspecified,Unspecified,Unit (1 acre),Unspecified,Year,Unspecified,Unspecified,2009,2009,Potentially ongoing,34,34,1742,38.85,38.85,34,38.85,38.85,USD,2009,Publication year,Potential,Extrapolation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Control,Management_costs,Post-invasion_management,Low,,,,,no,"Table 1.

SC72,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored.

SC74,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.

Labor is the most expensive portion of a weed management project. It is incumbent upon land managers to use methods that minimize labor costs, and this is especially so with public land managers because they are dependent upon tax dollars to execute their programs. Using herbicides and biological control agents to decrease the population abundance of a target invasive weed are approaches that utilize the least labor to affect initial and continued reduction of the target species. Because biocontrol is developed using public funds, it seems inexpensive to the end user, which includes federal agencies. Biocontrol is a very attractive and highly useful approach to control invasive weed species, however, success has been inconsistent in space and time. There are numerous successful biocontrol endeavors and the literature offers many examples. The USDA Forest Service’s Fire Effects Information System website (www. fs.fed.us/database/feis/) is one of the best and most complete information sources for the biology and management of many invasive weed species. Another outstanding source of information on managing invasive weeds which recently became available is Weed Control in Natural Areas in the Western United States (Joseph DiTomaso et al., 2013: University of California Weed Research and Information Center). It too describes where and upon what species biocontrol has been successful and extensively outlines all management options. If biocontrol is the method selected, land managers must carefully research choices for their effectiveness. The spatial and temporal variation associated with biocontrol performance may be due to many genetic and environmental reasons—from habitat preference by the biocontrol agent to the production of new genotypes from previously geographically separated genotypes now growing in proximity to one another, and many as yet to be discovered reasons. Fire too can be a good tool to decrease populations (DiTomaso et al. 2006) of some invasive weeds, most notably annual grasses and forbs such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). As with other integrated management systems for weeds, the use of fire to manage invasive weeds must be integrated with other tools, such as seeding, to provide competition to ward off recovering weed species and allow for completion of land management goals and objectives. Burning mixed brush-cheatgrass stands destroys some to many weed seeds and allows about one season of desirable vegetation to establish before cheatgrass re-establishes and dominates the site again (Evans and Young 1978; Young and Evans 1978; Young 2000). Establishing competitive perennial grass species may successfully keep cheatgrass from re-establishing. If, however, the system is left alone after burning, cheatgrass or medusahead will re-invade. Burning stands of yellow starthistle also can provide excellent population control if combined with herbicide treatment and seeding (DiTomaso et al. 2006b). Burning stands of a perennial weed, such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) and other knapweeds, or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), is rarely effective because of the plants’ ability to re-grow from its root system and dominate a site again. These and other similar invasive weeds may recover soon enough after a prescribed burn to preclude establishment of seeded species. If fire is used to control perennial forbs or grasses, herbicides will likely have to be integrated into the management system to allow sufficient suppression of the target weed for a long enough time to",2009,English,Slideshow presentation,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Asteraceae,Centaurea,Centaurea affinis/Centaurea stoebe,,spotted knapweed,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,NA,4,N,North America,USA,Diverse/Unspecified,Unspecified,Unit (1 acre),Unspecified,Year,Unspecified,Unspecified,2009,2009,Potentially ongoing,200,,,228.51,228.51,200,228.51,228.51,USD,2009,Publication year,Potential,Extrapolation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Damage repair,Damage_costs,NA,Low,,,,,no,"Table 1.

SC103,,Bailey2008,"Comparison of Three Physical Management Techniques for Controlling Variable-leaf Milfoil in Maine Lakes benthic barrier, exotic species, hand removal, invasive aquatic plants, milfoil, Myriophyllum heterophyllum, nuisance species EURASIAN WATERMILFO",Bailey JE Calhoun AJK,"Variable-leaf watermilfoil (Myriophyllum heterophyllum) is a nuisance aquatic plant in the northeastern United States. It grows in thick mats, often out-competing native vegetation, clogging boat motors, and deterring people from swimming and other water-related activities. We implemented three physical management techniques—hand removal, cutting, and benthic mats—on eight infested lakes in Maine to deter-mine the most effective method to control this aquatic inva-sive. All three treatments resulted in significantly lower plant regrowth than the control. No significant differences were found among the three treatments in plant regrowth or among lakes in percent regrowth of variable-leaf watermil-foil. The costs of hand removal and cutting were roughly one-third the cost of installing benthic mats, although mat installation required less time to implement than the other two methods. Cutting was found to be unrealistic in practice because of difficulties in implementation. In conclusion, de-termining the most effective management technique for an area depends on the extent and density of the infestation. Our results suggest benthic mats provide a cost-effective op-tion for thick, extensive infestations, whereas hand removal is more efficient in areas with small, high-density infestations or for selective removal in sparsely infested stands of mostly native macrophytes. Hand removal would also be useful dur-ing management surveys when individual plants or small clusters of variable-leaf watermilfoil are detected.

SC114,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.

It grows in thick mats, often out-competing native vegetation, clogging boat motors, and deterring people from swimming and other water-related activities. We implemented three physical management techniques—hand removal, cutting, and benthic mats—on eight infested lakes in Maine to deter-mine the most effective method to control this aquatic inva-sive. All three treatments resulted in significantly lower plant regrowth than the control. No significant differences were found among the three treatments in plant regrowth or among lakes in percent regrowth of variable-leaf watermil-foil. The costs of hand removal and cutting were roughly one-third the cost of installing benthic mats, although mat installation required less time to implement than the other two methods. Cutting was found to be unrealistic in practice because of difficulties in implementation. In conclusion, de-termining the most effective management technique for an area depends on the extent and density of the infestation.

SC120,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

It grows in thick mats, often out-competing native vegetation, clogging boat motors, and deterring people from swimming and other water-related activities. We implemented three physical management techniques—hand removal, cutting, and benthic mats—on eight infested lakes in Maine to deter-mine the most effective method to control this aquatic inva-sive. All three treatments resulted in significantly lower plant regrowth than the control. No significant differences were found among the three treatments in plant regrowth or among lakes in percent regrowth of variable-leaf watermil-foil. The costs of hand removal and cutting were roughly one-third the cost of installing benthic mats, although mat installation required less time to implement than the other two methods. Cutting was found to be unrealistic in practice because of difficulties in implementation. In conclusion, de-termining the most effective management technique for an area depends on the extent and density of the infestation. Our results suggest benthic mats provide a cost-effective op-tion for thick, extensive infestations, whereas hand removal is more efficient in areas with small, high-density infestations or for selective removal in sparsely infested stands of mostly native macrophytes.

SC131,,Beck2009,"Economics of Invasive Weed Control: Chemical, Manual/Physical/Fire, Biological, and Doing Nothing",Beck,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] Financial Costs Per Acre and Impacts to Budgets Regardless of whether working for private enterprise or government, land management personnel must stretch limited budgets yet be effective simultaneously. Labor is the most expensive portion of a weed management project. It is incumbent upon land managers to use methods that minimize labor costs, and this is especially so with public land managers because they are dependent upon tax dollars to execute their programs. Using herbicides and biological control agents to decrease the population abundance of a target invasive weed are approaches that utilize the least labor to affect initial and continued reduction of the target species. Because biocontrol is developed using public funds, it seems inexpensive to the end user, which includes federal agencies. Biocontrol is a very attractive and highly useful approach to control invasive weed species, however, success has been inconsistent in space and time. There are numerous successful biocontrol endeavors and the literature offers many examples. The USDA Forest Service’s Fire Effects Information System website (www. fs.fed.us/database/feis/) is one of the best and most complete information sources for the biology and management of many invasive weed species. Another outstanding source of information on managing invasive weeds which recently became available is Weed Control in Natural Areas in the Western United States (Joseph DiTomaso et al., 2013: University of California Weed Research and Information Center). It too describes where and upon what species biocontrol has been successful and extensively outlines all management options. If biocontrol is the method selected, land managers must carefully research choices for their effectiveness. The spatial and temporal variation associated with biocontrol performance may be due to many genetic and environmental reasons—from habitat preference by the biocontrol agent to the production of new genotypes from previously geographically separated genotypes now growing in proximity to one another, and many as yet to be discovered reasons. Fire too can be a good tool to decrease populations (DiTomaso et al. 2006) of some invasive weeds, most notably annual grasses and forbs such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). As with other integrated management systems for weeds, the use of fire to manage invasive weeds must be integrated with other tools, such as seeding, to provide competition to ward off recovering weed species and allow for completion of land management goals and objectives. Burning mixed brush-cheatgrass stands destroys some to many weed seeds and allows about one season of desirable vegetation to establish before cheatgrass re-establishes and dominates the site again (Evans and Young 1978; Young and Evans 1978; Young 2000). Establishing competitive perennial grass species may successfully keep cheatgrass from re-establishing. If, however, the system is left alone after burning, cheatgrass or medusahead will re-invade. Burning stands of yellow starthistle also can provide excellent population control if combined with herbicide treatment and seeding (DiTomaso et al. 2006b). Burning stands of a perennial weed, such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) and other knapweeds, or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), is rarely effective because of the plants’ ability to re-grow from its root system and dominate a site again. These and other similar invasive weeds may recover soon enough after a prescribed burn to preclude establishment of seeded species. If fire is used to control perennial forbs or grasses, herbicides will likely have to be integrated into the management system to allow sufficient suppression of the target weed for a long enough time to",2009,English,Slideshow presentation,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Asteraceae,Centaurea,Centaurea affinis/Centaurea stoebe,,spotted knapweed,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,NA,4,N,North America,USA,Diverse/Unspecified,Unspecified,Unit (10 acres),Unspecified,Year,Unspecified,Unspecified,2009,2009,Potentially ongoing,340,340,17420,388.47,388.47,340,388.47,388.47,USD,2009,Publication year,Potential,Extrapolation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Control,Management_costs,Post-invasion_management,Low,,,,,no,"Table 1.

Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

SC155,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.

The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one

standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

SC201,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.

Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC204,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management.

The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one

standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

SC226,,Panetta2009,Weed eradication - an economic perspective,"Panetta, FD","There has been recent interest in determining the upper limits to the feasibility of weed eradication. Although a number of disparate factors determine the success of an eradication program, ultimately eradication feasibility must be viewed in the context of the amount of investment that can be made. The latter should reflect the hazard posed by an invasion, with greater investment justified by greater threats. In simplest terms, the effort (and hence investment) to achieve weed eradication comprises the detection effort required to delimit an invasion plus the search and control effort required to prevent reproduction until extirpation occurs over the entire infested area. The difficulty of estimating the required investment at the commencement of a weed eradication program (as well as during periodic reviews) is a serious problem. Bioeconomics show promise in determining the optimal approach to managing weed invasions, notwithstanding ongoing difficulties in estimating the costs and benefits of eradication and alternative invasion management strategies. A flexible approach to the management of weed invasions is needed, allowing for the adoption of another strategy when it becomes clear that the probability of eradication is low, owing to resourcing or intractable technical issues. Whether the considerable progress that has been achieved towards eradication of the once massive witchweed invasion can be duplicated for other weeds of agricultural systems will depend to a large extent upon investment (. $250 million over 50 yr in this instance). Weeds of natural ecosystems seem destined to remain more difficult eradication targets for a variety of reasons, including higher impedance to eradication, more difficulty in valuing the benefits arising from eradication, and possibly less willingness to pay from society at large.",2009,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Asteraceae,Centaurea,Centaurea trichocephala,,featherhead knapweed,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,abandoned pasture,4,N,North America,USA,Washington,Abandoned Pasture,Unit (<1 ha),5 years,Period,Unspecified,Unspecified,2005,2009,One-time,1408,,,1602.99,1602.99,281.6,320.6,320.6,USD,2008,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Eradication,Management_costs,Post-invasion_management,High,,,,,no,"Costs of a successful weed eradication, citing Mack & Lonsdale 2002; used gross area (area treated + area searched)",Jennifer Bufford,

SC230,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent.

Here we examined ODNR records and aerial photographs using ArcGIS so— ware and planimetry from 2000 to 2007 to (1) track annual changes in reed localities and areal coverage, (2) compare short-term eff ectiveness of glyphosate (Glypro® and AquaNeat®) and imazapyr (Habitat®) herbicides, and (3) estimate control costs. Reed › rst appeared in a small, isolated patch in 1998 but expanded to comprise approximately 18 percent of the marsh’s emergent vegetation by 2001. Annual change in areal cover was not related to minor changes in already low Lake Erie water levels. However, reed amount decreased from 6.7 ha (= 14.8 percent of emergent vegetation) in 2004 to 2.5 ha in 2007 a— er a two- to three-fold annual increase in amount of herbicide used.  Short-term, post-spraying necrosis (browning) was slower for Phragmites treated with a › ve percent Habitat® solution than with a 30 percent AquaNeat® solution. Slowed necrosis presumably prolongs photosynthesis and plant nutrient uptake and delays habitat deterioration for some wildlife, but provides time for vegetative spread. Seven years of herbiciding have contained reed to approximately six percent of the emergent plant cover. Estimated control expenditures from 2003 to 2007 were $8475 USD (average approximately $1700/year); a small cost to maintain system ecological diversity.",2008,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Poales,Poaceae,Phragmites,Phragmites australis,,Common reed,Aquatic,semi-aquatic,N,NA,10,N,North America,USA,,Florida,Unit (Lake),2008,Period,2003,2008,2003,2008,Potentially ongoing,1700,,,1935.43,1935.43,283.33,322.57,322.57,USD,2008,Publication year,Observed,Report/Estimation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Control,Management_costs,Post-invasion_management,High,,,,,no,Control costs,Phillip Haubrock,

Labor is the most expensive portion of a weed management project. It is incumbent upon land managers to use methods that minimize labor costs, and this is especially so with public land managers because they are dependent upon tax dollars to execute their programs. Using herbicides and biological control agents to decrease the population abundance of a target invasive weed are approaches that utilize the least labor to affect initial and continued reduction of the target species. Because biocontrol is developed using public funds, it seems inexpensive to the end user, which includes federal agencies. Biocontrol is a very attractive and highly useful approach to control invasive weed species, however, success has been inconsistent in space and time. There are numerous successful biocontrol endeavors and the literature offers many examples. The USDA Forest Service’s Fire Effects Information System website (www. fs.fed.us/database/feis/) is one of the best and most complete information sources for the biology and management of many invasive weed species. Another outstanding source of information on managing invasive weeds which recently became available is Weed Control in Natural Areas in the Western United States (Joseph DiTomaso et al., 2013: University of California Weed Research and Information Center). It too describes where and upon what species biocontrol has been successful and extensively outlines all management options. If biocontrol is the method selected, land managers must carefully research choices for their effectiveness. The spatial and temporal variation associated with biocontrol performance may be due to many genetic and environmental reasons—from habitat preference by the biocontrol agent to the production of new genotypes from previously geographically separated genotypes now growing in proximity to one another, and many as yet to be discovered reasons. Fire too can be a good tool to decrease populations (DiTomaso et al. 2006) of some invasive weeds, most notably annual grasses and forbs such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). As with other integrated management systems for weeds, the use of fire to manage invasive weeds must be integrated with other tools, such as seeding, to provide competition to ward off recovering weed species and allow for completion of land management goals and objectives. Burning mixed brush-cheatgrass stands destroys some to many weed seeds and allows about one season of desirable vegetation to establish before cheatgrass re-establishes and dominates the site again (Evans and Young 1978; Young and Evans 1978; Young 2000). Establishing competitive perennial grass species may successfully keep cheatgrass from re-establishing. If, however, the system is left alone after burning, cheatgrass or medusahead will re-invade. Burning stands of yellow starthistle also can provide excellent population control if combined with herbicide treatment and seeding (DiTomaso et al. 2006b). Burning stands of a perennial weed, such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) and other knapweeds, or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), is rarely effective because of the plants’ ability to re-grow from its root system and dominate a site again. These and other similar invasive weeds may recover soon enough after a prescribed burn to preclude establishment of seeded species.

Two adjacent vegetation management experiments were initiated in 2006 and monitored until 2010 in eastern Nevada to compare the costs and efﬁcacy of various tree reduction methods. One Department of Energy (DOE) experiment compared a control to ﬁve treatments: bulldozing imitating chaining ($205 ha 1), lop-pile-burn ($2309 ha 1), lop-and-scatter ($1297 ha 1), feller-buncher and chipper ($4940 ha 1), and mastication ($1136 ha 1), whereas a second Bureau of Land Management (BLM) experiment compared one-way chaining ($205 ha 1) to a control treatment. Chaining and bulldozing resulted in the least reduction of tree cover among the treatments. In the DOE experiment, forb cover only decreased in the mastication treatment. Litter increased in all methods. Slash cover was lowest in the control and lop-pile-burn treatments, intermediate in the feller-buncher and mastication treatments, and highest in the bulldozing and lop-and-scatter treatments. By 2010, forb cover and the combined cover of dead shrubs and trees were increased and decreased, respectively, by chaining in the BLM experiment. Nonnative annual grass and biotic crust were absent or uncommon before and after treatment implementation. In both experiments, tree removal resulted in a nonsigniﬁcant increase in perennial grass cover even 4 yr post-treatment. An ecological return-on-investment (EROI) metric was developed to compare perennial grass cover and tree cover per unit area cost of each active treatment. By 2010, chaining or bulldozing, followed by mastication, showed the highest EROI for improving perennial grass and decreasing tree cover. Mastication is recommended for restoration of smaller tree-encroached areas, whereas land managers should reconsider smooth chaining, despite its negative perceptions, for rapid and cost-efﬁcient restoration of large landscapes obligates.

SC353,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This study evaluates the economic impacts of tamarisk (Tamarix sp.), an invasive woody shrub, on societally-valued ecosystem services in its naturalized range. Tamarisk, intentionally introduced from Eurasia, has invaded most riparian areas of the arid and semiarid western United States. In its naturalized range, tamarisk consumes more water than native vegetation, with significant economic implications in a region marked by water scarcity. Tamarisk also increases sedimentation in river channels, leading to increased frequency and severity of flood damage. Conservative economic estimates of these impacts indicate that the annual costs of tamarisk to the western United States total USD 280–450 ha–1. Eradicating the invader and restoring native riparian communities throughout the region would cost approximately USD 7400 ha–1.

SC388,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).

A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.

Ballistic Technology (HBT) is a novel weed control tool designed to pneumatically deliver encapsulated herbicide
projectiles. It is capable of accurately treating miconia satellites within a 30 m range in either horizontal or vertical
trajectories. Efficacy was examined for the encapsulated herbicide projectiles, each containing 199.4 mg ae triclopyr,
when applied to miconia in 5-unit increments. Experimental calibrations of the HBT platform were recorded on a
Hughes 500-D helicopter while conducting surveillance operations from November 2010 through October 2011 on
the islands of Maui and Kauai. Search efficiency (min ha21; n 5 13, R2 5 0.933, P, 0.001) and target acquisition
rate (plants hr21, n 5 13, R2 5 0.926, P, 0.001) displayed positive linear and logarithmic relationships,
respectively, to plant target density. The search efficiency equation estimated target acquisition time at 25.1 sec and a
minimum surveillance rate of 67.8 s ha21 when no targets were detected. The maximum target acquisition rate for
the HBT platform was estimated at 143 targets hr21. An average mortality factor of 0.542 was derived from the
product of detection efficacy (0.560) and operational treatment efficacy (0.972) in overlapping buffer areas

For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

challenge ecological restoration globally. Ecological monitoring of restoration
is typically short term and rarely reassessed to determine if initial findings are
indicative of multiyear outcomes, and economic costs of restoration are seldom
quantified. To address these knowledge gaps, we resampled a restoration experiment
in an invasive Megathyrsus maximus – dominated ecosystem in Hawai‘i
to compare success of restoration treatments at 8 and 36 months. We calculated
cost to establish and maintain (for 3 yr) experimental field trials (0.13 ha)
and management-scale (1 ha and 10 ha) units, estimated 30-yr costs for
management-
scale units, and determined key drivers of costs. Survival of native
outplant species did not differ between 8- (56%) and 36-month (51%) monitoring
periods, and M. maximus cover was lower in restoration treatments than in
control plots at both time periods. Cost to establish and maintain the experimental
trial was $14,299 (Present Value at 2% annual discount rate, 2015 US$;
$109,993 ha−1). Scaling up restoration to 1 and 10 ha units produced economies
of scale, with 3 yr costs declining with increasing area ($149,918 ha−1 for 1 ha;
$124,139 ha−1 for 10 ha). Total Present Value to restore and maintain a 1 ha site
for 30 yr ranged from $153,195 to $302,917 ha−1, varying primarily based on
labor and seedling costs. This study demonstrates that early restoration results
can be indicative of longer-term results, establishment expenses drive long-term

SC468,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management.

Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.

The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate.

SC488,,Beck2009,"Economics of Invasive Weed Control: Chemical, Manual/Physical/Fire, Biological, and Doing Nothing",Beck,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] Financial Costs Per Acre and Impacts to Budgets Regardless of whether working for private enterprise or government, land management personnel must stretch limited budgets yet be effective simultaneously. Labor is the most expensive portion of a weed management project. It is incumbent upon land managers to use methods that minimize labor costs, and this is especially so with public land managers because they are dependent upon tax dollars to execute their programs. Using herbicides and biological control agents to decrease the population abundance of a target invasive weed are approaches that utilize the least labor to affect initial and continued reduction of the target species. Because biocontrol is developed using public funds, it seems inexpensive to the end user, which includes federal agencies. Biocontrol is a very attractive and highly useful approach to control invasive weed species, however, success has been inconsistent in space and time. There are numerous successful biocontrol endeavors and the literature offers many examples. The USDA Forest Service’s Fire Effects Information System website (www. fs.fed.us/database/feis/) is one of the best and most complete information sources for the biology and management of many invasive weed species. Another outstanding source of information on managing invasive weeds which recently became available is Weed Control in Natural Areas in the Western United States (Joseph DiTomaso et al., 2013: University of California Weed Research and Information Center). It too describes where and upon what species biocontrol has been successful and extensively outlines all management options. If biocontrol is the method selected, land managers must carefully research choices for their effectiveness. The spatial and temporal variation associated with biocontrol performance may be due to many genetic and environmental reasons—from habitat preference by the biocontrol agent to the production of new genotypes from previously geographically separated genotypes now growing in proximity to one another, and many as yet to be discovered reasons. Fire too can be a good tool to decrease populations (DiTomaso et al. 2006) of some invasive weeds, most notably annual grasses and forbs such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). As with other integrated management systems for weeds, the use of fire to manage invasive weeds must be integrated with other tools, such as seeding, to provide competition to ward off recovering weed species and allow for completion of land management goals and objectives. Burning mixed brush-cheatgrass stands destroys some to many weed seeds and allows about one season of desirable vegetation to establish before cheatgrass re-establishes and dominates the site again (Evans and Young 1978; Young and Evans 1978; Young 2000). Establishing competitive perennial grass species may successfully keep cheatgrass from re-establishing. If, however, the system is left alone after burning, cheatgrass or medusahead will re-invade. Burning stands of yellow starthistle also can provide excellent population control if combined with herbicide treatment and seeding (DiTomaso et al. 2006b). Burning stands of a perennial weed, such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) and other knapweeds, or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), is rarely effective because of the plants’ ability to re-grow from its root system and dominate a site again. These and other similar invasive weeds may recover soon enough after a prescribed burn to preclude establishment of seeded species. If fire is used to control perennial forbs or grasses, herbicides will likely have to be integrated into the management system to allow sufficient suppression of the target weed for a long enough time to",2009,English,Slideshow presentation,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Asteraceae,Centaurea,Centaurea affinis/Centaurea stoebe,,spotted knapweed,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,NA,4,N,North America,USA,Diverse/Unspecified,Unspecified,Unit (100 acres),Unspecified,Year,Unspecified,Unspecified,2009,2009,Potentially ongoing,20000,,,22851.03,22851.03,20000,22851.03,22851.03,USD,2009,Publication year,Potential,Extrapolation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Damage repair,Damage_costs,NA,Low,,,,,no,"Table 1.

SC489,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC548,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one.

For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC569,,Horsch2008,Quantifying the Economic Effects of Invasive Species?: A Non-Market Valuation Analysis of Eurasian Watermilfoil,"Horsch, E.J.","One consequence of our increasingly globalized world is the ease at which humans and
other species can move or be moved around the planet. As a result, exotic species have been
accidentally or intentionally introduced to non-native areas, many of which have become
invasive. Consequently, vast sums of money are spent each year to control the spread of
invasive species and to address their adverse effects on ecosystems and the economy.
Generally, the costs of invasive species are estimated based on the costs of managing
species invasions, including the amount that must be spent to repair infrastructure damage.
However, this is a conservative estimate of the social costs associated with invasive species as
they also affect biodiversity, ecosystems, and other environmental amenities whose values are
not readily observed in a market. Relatively little economic research has been done concerning
the non-market effects of invasive species.
The purpose of this study is to estimate a hedonic pricing model of lakeshore property
values to quantify the economic costs of a common aquatic invasive species, Eurasian
watermilfoil (EWM), across an extensive lake system in the northern forest region of Wisconsin.
The hedonic pricing model is estimated using a database on property sales and lake-specific
characteristics over the period 1997-2006.
While the primary purpose of the hedonic analysis is to isolate the price effect associated
with the presence and abundance of EWM, two major econometric challenges arise: spatial
autocorrelation and the endogeneity of EWM. Spatial autocorrelation arises due to the fact that
the prices associated with multiple parcels on the same lake are likely to be influenced by similar
unobserved lake-specific characteristics. Endogeneity problems arise because EWM is typically
spread by the movement of recreational boaters, where boaters are more likely to visit lakes with
attractive characteristics. To the extent that the attractiveness of a lake is unobserved to the
analyst, EWM will be correlated with the error term in the hedonic model and OLS estimation
will produce coefficient estimates that are positively biased.
Both issues are accounted for, in part, by defining each lake as a natural neighborhood
and estimating a fixed effect for each lake within the model. The endogeneity of EWM is further
accounted for by exploiting recent EWM invasions as a natural experiment with a difference-indifference
approach to hedonic analysis. Since only a portion of properties in the data set are
affected by EWM, this methodology is useful for identifying the unbiased effect of EWM,
eliminating any differences that may have been present before its introduction. Thus, the
methodology used requires a panel data set to ensure observations are present both before and
after the introduction of EWM.
Results indicate that lakes invaded with EWM experienced an average decrease in land
values by 13% after invasion. The EWM results are robust across linear and non-linear
specifications. This study addresses a topic that is both unique to the current environmental
economics literature and yet widely important for all natural resource management. Despite the
documented prevalence and detrimental effects of EWM, the associated economic and social
costs are yet to be understood. In addition, the econometric challenges seen in this study are
highly relevant to the field in general, particularly with the growing focus on spatial
econometrics. Solutions for the issues of spatial autocorrelation and endogeneity remain elusive.
The spatial difference-in-difference specification presented in this study offers a unique solution
to these challenges, yet is simple enough to be estimated with linear regression techniques.",2008,English,PhD thesis,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Saxifragales,Haloragaceae,Myriophyllum,Myriophyllum spicatum,,Eurasian watermilfoil,Aquatic,aquatic,N,NA,11,N,North America,USA,,Wisconsin,Unit (property),2008,Year,Unspecified,Unspecified,2008,2008,Potentially ongoing,35000,30000,40000,39847.12,39847.12,35000,39847.12,39847.12,USD,2008,Publication year,Potential,Report/Estimation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,Low,,,,,no,"He estimates that a $250,000 home on a lake

SC574,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.

SC605,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

especially in North America. The Watershed Management Plan for Otsego Lake, a central New York glacial lake, provides for
prevention of AIS via a stringent boat inspection and washing program (BIP). All boats entering Otsego Lake at the public launch
are visually inspected and those deemed likely to harbor AIS are required to power wash before launching. However, other sites are
available to launch boats. BIP expenses average $30,000 per year, much of which has been covered by collecting a launch fee. After
implementation of the BIP, only one boat was refused access, and less than 1% required washing before allowed access, however,
zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and water chestnut (Trapa natans) have since been found in the lake. The BIP continues to be

We   estimated   hydropower   maintenance   costs   associated   with   zebra   mussels   by   examining  the  Bonneville  Dam  First  Powerhouse,  costs  associated  with  Asian  clam  (Corbicula fluminea) control at Bonneville, and a survey of zebra mussel mitigation costs at other hydropower generation facilities in North America. We   found   that   the   one-time   cost   for   installing   zebra   mussel   control   systems   at   hydroelectric  projects  could  range  from  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  to  over  a  million dollars per facility.  The estimated cost for a hypothetical zebra mussel mitigation strategy,  based  upon  two  response  scenarios  (a  sodium  hypochlorite  (NaOCl)  injection  system and anti-fouling paint), at 13 select hydroelectric projects, was $23,621,000.  The cost per generator was $62,599 for the NaOCl system, and $81,000 for antifouling paint (not including labor).  Removal, painting, sandblasting and installation could potentially double antifouling paint treatment costs.  We estimated that if a NaOCl system was installed at an “average” size Columbia River Basin facility, assuming intermittent use, annual operating costs would likely not exceed $100,000.    Operating  costs  will  vary  depending  on  the  facility,  degree  of  infestation,  environmental permits, etc. This  investigation  found  that  once  utilities  initiate  long-term  mussel  control  programs,  they usually become part of routine maintenance at annual, biennial, or longer intervals, depending on how rapidly the mussels recolonize the systems.   A detailed management plan is needed to determine the best zebra mussel mitigation and control strategy for the FCRPS. The management plan should detail key agency contacts and  coordination;  control  technologies;  permit  requirements;  costs  for  the  hydroelectric  and nuclear facilities, transportation, upstream and downstream fish passage system; and the  environmental  impacts  of  likely  mitigation  technologies.

3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one

standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

In this study, we developed a simulation model to build and evaluate 5-yr weed treatment plan options in terms of their cost and effectiveness in minimizing total infestation areas over the short-term planning horizon. In an iterative, interactive process, 5-yr treatment plan options are developed based on user-defined weed treatment preferences, and evaluated in terms of total projected infestation areas at the end of the planning horizon. The simulation model was applied to a study area of 24,867 ha (61,447 ac) located in the Salmon River watershed in Idaho. Eight treatment plan options were developed using two treatment priority strategies and four increasing budget levels, and compared for their effectiveness. The application results showed that regardless of budget levels, site priority strategies were more cost-effective than the species priority strategies in reducing total infestation areas over time. This simulation model can provide weed managers with a useful tool to evaluate short-term treatment options, and thus support informed decision-making for effective weed management.

SC647,,Frasier2014,Economic Impact of Invasive Weed Species in Colorado: Phase I.,"Frasier, W.

SC651,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management.

SC685,,Leary2013,Calibration of an herbicide ballistic technology (HBT) helicopter platform targeting Miconia calvescens in Hawaii,"Leary, JK, Gooding J, Chapman J, Radford A, Mahnken B, Cox LJ","Miconia (Miconia calvescens DC.) is a tropical tree species from South and Central America that is a highly invasive
colonizer of Hawaii’s forested watersheds. Elimination of satellite populations is critical to an effective containment
strategy, but extreme topography limits accessibility to remote populations by helicopter operations only. Herbicide
Ballistic Technology (HBT) is a novel weed control tool designed to pneumatically deliver encapsulated herbicide
projectiles. It is capable of accurately treating miconia satellites within a 30 m range in either horizontal or vertical
trajectories. Efficacy was examined for the encapsulated herbicide projectiles, each containing 199.4 mg ae triclopyr,
when applied to miconia in 5-unit increments. Experimental calibrations of the HBT platform were recorded on a
Hughes 500-D helicopter while conducting surveillance operations from November 2010 through October 2011 on
the islands of Maui and Kauai. Search efficiency (min ha21; n 5 13, R2 5 0.933, P, 0.001) and target acquisition
rate (plants hr21, n 5 13, R2 5 0.926, P, 0.001) displayed positive linear and logarithmic relationships,
respectively, to plant target density. The search efficiency equation estimated target acquisition time at 25.1 sec and a
minimum surveillance rate of 67.8 s ha21 when no targets were detected. The maximum target acquisition rate for
the HBT platform was estimated at 143 targets hr21. An average mortality factor of 0.542 was derived from the
product of detection efficacy (0.560) and operational treatment efficacy (0.972) in overlapping buffer areas
generated from repeated flight segments (n 5 5). This population reduction value was used in simulation models to
estimate the expected costs for one- and multi-year satellite population control strategies for qualifying options in
cost optimization and risk aversion. This is a first report on the performance of an HBT helicopter platform
demonstrating the capability for immediate, rapid-response control of new satellite plant detections, while

Although a variety of studies have been implemented in surrounding states,  even basic ColoradoͲspecific impacts have yet to be calculated. Phase I of this project addresses  this gap by leveraging a formed partnership between the Colorado Department of Agriculture,  Colorado Department of Natural Resources, CWMA, and Colorado State University to document  the basic economic impacts of a prioritized list of terrestrial and aquatic noxious weeds to the  State of Colorado.   Given the numerous and varied types of impacts of differential invasive species across the state  (including but not limited to agriculture, energy, infrastructure, natural resources, tourism, and  ecosystem services), this project is conceptualized as a sequence of interconnected yet  reasonably separate studies. The first phase provides a rough outline of the impacts of selected  species across the state.

We use hedonic modeling to evaluate the economic effects of Eurasian milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) invasions on lakefront property values of single-family homes in an urban-suburban landscape. Milfoil often forms dense canopies at the water surface, diminishing the value of ecosystem services (e.g., recreation, fishing) and necessitating expensive control and management efforts. We compare 1,258 lakeshore property sale transactions (1995–2006) in 17 lakes with milfoil and 24 un-invaded lakes in King County, Washington (USA). After accounting for structural (e.g., house size), locational (e.g., boat launch), and environmental characteristics (e.g., water clarity) of lakes, we found that milfoil has a significant negative effect on property sales price ($94,385 USD lower price), corresponding to a 19% decline in mean property values. The aggregate cost of milfoil invading one additional lake in the study area is, on average, $377,542 USD per year. Our study illustrates that invasive aquatic plants can significantly impact property values (and associated losses in property taxes that reduce local government revenue), justifying the need for management strategies that prevent and control invasions. We recommend coordinated efforts across Lake Management Districts to focus institutional support, funding, and outreach to prevent the introduction and spread of milfoil. This effort will limit opportunities for re-introduction from neighboring lakes and incentivize private landowners and natural resource agencies to commit time and funding to invasive species management.",2014,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Saxifragales,Haloragaceae,Myriophyllum,Myriophyllum spicatum,,Eurasian milfoil,Aquatic,aquatic,N,lake,11,N,North America,USA,Washington,"King County, Washington (17 Invaded Lakes, 24 Uninvaded Lakes)",Unit (lakeside property values),1995 - 2006,Year,1995,2006,1995,2006,Potentially ongoing,94385,92558,94670,114764.72,114764.72,94385,114764.72,114764.72,USD,2006,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Public and social welfare,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,High,,,,,no,"""The hedonic model comprised of lakefront property sales price as the dependent variable, which was deflated to 2006 property values (USD) using the house price index (purchase only) from the US Federal Housing Finance Agency.""

of sites in western Nevada and northeastern California, including Lake Tahoe. Because Eurasian
watermilfoil is easily spread by fragments, transport on boats and boating equipment plays a key
role in contaminating new water bodies. This is an important means of the potential spread of this
weed throughout key recreational and agricultural areas surrounding Lake Tahoe. Unless the weed
is controlled, significant alterations of aquatic ecosystems, with associated degradation of natural
resources and economic damages to human uses of those resources, may occur. This research uses
the economic valuation approach known as benefits transfer to estimate the value of a portion of the
recreational service flows that society currently enjoys in the Truckee River watershed below Lake
Tahoe. The lower-bound estimates of baseline water-based recreation value at a subset of sites in the
watershed range from $30 to $45 million/yr. Impacts from the continued spread of Eurasian watermilfoil

We   estimated   hydropower   maintenance   costs   associated   with   zebra   mussels   by   examining  the  Bonneville  Dam  First  Powerhouse,  costs  associated  with  Asian  clam  (Corbicula fluminea) control at Bonneville, and a survey of zebra mussel mitigation costs at other hydropower generation facilities in North America. We   found   that   the   one-time   cost   for   installing   zebra   mussel   control   systems   at   hydroelectric  projects  could  range  from  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  to  over  a  million dollars per facility.  The estimated cost for a hypothetical zebra mussel mitigation strategy,  based  upon  two  response  scenarios  (a  sodium  hypochlorite  (NaOCl)  injection  system and anti-fouling paint), at 13 select hydroelectric projects, was $23,621,000.  The cost per generator was $62,599 for the NaOCl system, and $81,000 for antifouling paint (not including labor).  Removal, painting, sandblasting and installation could potentially double antifouling paint treatment costs.  We estimated that if a NaOCl system was installed at an “average” size Columbia River Basin facility, assuming intermittent use, annual operating costs would likely not exceed $100,000.    Operating  costs  will  vary  depending  on  the  facility,  degree  of  infestation,  environmental permits, etc. This  investigation  found  that  once  utilities  initiate  long-term  mussel  control  programs,  they usually become part of routine maintenance at annual, biennial, or longer intervals, depending on how rapidly the mussels recolonize the systems.   A detailed management plan is needed to determine the best zebra mussel mitigation and control strategy for the FCRPS. The management plan should detail key agency contacts and  coordination;  control  technologies;  permit  requirements;  costs  for  the  hydroelectric  and nuclear facilities, transportation, upstream and downstream fish passage system; and the  environmental  impacts  of  likely  mitigation  technologies.

SC753,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

The Great Lakes span a distance of 1200 km and cover a surface area of 244 000 km2 (Fuller et al. 1995). They account for 18% of the planet’s supply of fresh surface water, which is surpassed in volume only by the polar ice caps (only 1% of the Great Lakes’ freshwater supply is renewable). The waters of the Great Lakes flow eastward into the Atlantic Ocean through the
St. Lawrence River. The ecosystems contained within the Great Lakes drainage basin are richly diverse and include 100 taxa and 31 ecological community types
that are considered globally significant by the Nature Conservancy (Rankin and Crispin 1994). The Great Lakes basin has also been important to the history and development of the United States and Canada. Significant industrial and agricultural development has occurred within the basin: 45% of Canada’s industrial capacity
and 25% of Canada’s agricultural capacity. More than 33 million people live within the Great Lakes basin (Fuller et al. 1995), with about 9 million residing in Canada. Great Lakes water resources provide billions of dollars of economic value and thousands of jobs to the region.

SC790,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored.

SC806,TC,MarylandDNR2004,Potential Economic Losses Associated With Uncontrolled Nutria Populations in Maryland's Portion of the Chesapeake Bay,Maryland Department of Natural Resources,"Nutria (Myocaster coypus) are non-native aquatic mammals that are having an
unprecedented negative effect on the marshes and ecology of the Chesapeake Bay. Since
their introduction in the 1930's, nutria populations have continued to expand. With their
high reproductive rate and voracious appetite for marsh grasses and root mats, they are
now damaging hundreds of acres of valuable wetlands each year and turning oncevegetated
areas into mudflats and open-water. These denuded areas no longer provide
rich spawning and nursery grounds and habitat for the many species of shellfish, fish and
wildlife that this region is known for. Although the effects of nutria cannot be easily
separated from other detrimental factors, they are widely believed to be a large
contributing cause of the decline in the quality and extent of Chesapeake Bay wetlands.
As more and more acres of Chesapeake Bay marshes are lost, the resulting declines in
commercially and recreationally-valuable species takes a measurable economic toll on
the State ofMaiyland and its citizens. Commercial harvesting of shellfish and finfish,
sport hunting and fishing, and wildlife viewing in Maryland all have strong connections
to the wetlands of the Chesapeake and these sectors suffer as the marshes deteriorate. In
order to assess the economic effects this decline represents, this report analyzed scientific
literature, expert opinions and economic indices for commercial and recreational uses of
marshland and marsh-associated species in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay.
If marshes continue to be lost at the current rate, the financial losses to the State of
Maryland and its citizens are summarized in Table E-1 and E-2, below. In Table E-1, it
is clear that the direct losses due to declines in commercially and recreationally-valued
species alone are considerable annually and over the next 50 years. In Table E-2, it is
demonstrated that the losses in environmental services provided by wetlands, and the
associated social losses add another layer to the costs.   Taken together, the figures represented in Tables E-1 and E-2 present a challenge to the
State of Maryland and its citizens. These losses can be mitigated and lessened
considerably if marsh loss is slowed by removal of nutria. Otherwise, the economic
ramifications of damage to Chesapeake Bay marshes in the past and into the future are
costly and will continue to increase unless the necessary actions are taken. The costs of
nutria removal are potentially minor compared to the costs to the State if the loss of
marsh habitats continues unabated.",2004,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Myocastoridae,Myocastor,Myocastor coypus,,nutria,Aquatic,semi-aquatic,N,Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay; emergent wetlands,11,NA,North America,USA,Maryland,Chesapeake Bay,Unit (part of bay),"""current"" + ""2001"" ",Year,2001,2001,2001,2001,Potentially ongoing,168709,,,218938.74,218938.74,168709,218938.74,218938.74,USD,2004,Publication year,Observed,Report/Estimation,Environment/Public and social welfare,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,High,,,,,no,"Environmental services loss in Table E2.

SC815,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

SC838,,Frasier2014,Economic Impact of Invasive Weed Species in Colorado: Phase I.,"Frasier, W.

Although a variety of studies have been implemented in surrounding states,  even basic ColoradoͲspecific impacts have yet to be calculated. Phase I of this project addresses  this gap by leveraging a formed partnership between the Colorado Department of Agriculture,  Colorado Department of Natural Resources, CWMA, and Colorado State University to document  the basic economic impacts of a prioritized list of terrestrial and aquatic noxious weeds to the  State of Colorado.   Given the numerous and varied types of impacts of differential invasive species across the state  (including but not limited to agriculture, energy, infrastructure, natural resources, tourism, and  ecosystem services), this project is conceptualized as a sequence of interconnected yet  reasonably separate studies.

SC840,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management.

SC864,,Nealis2002,"Gypsy moth in Canada: case study of an invasive insect. Pages 151-159 in Claudi et al. (2002) Alien Invaders in Canada's Water, Wetlands, and Forests",Nealis V.G.,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L.)) is a native insect of Eurasia where it feeds on the leaves of broadleaf trees, especially oaks (Quercus spp.). Populations of gypsy moth increase periodically to very high local densities and severely defoliate preferred host trees (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990). In its native range, gypsy moth displays highly variable biological characteristics. The most significant life-history variations relevant to invasiveness are the geographic differences in flight capability of adult females and host food range of the larvae. Female moths from western (European) populations are flightless, while those from eastern (Asian) populations are capable of strong, directed flight. Gypsy moth larvae feed on a wide variety of mostly broadleaf tree hosts throughout their geographic range, but Asian populations also feed on coniferous tree species and therefore are of even greater concern to Canada than the European populations.
A European strain of the gypsy moth escaped from a laboratory near Boston, MA, in 1869. Since then, gypsy moth has spread and become established in the temperate forests of eastern North America, approximately between latitudes 36° and 47°N, and from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes basin as far as 90°W. During this same period, there have been repeated interceptions of both European and Asian strains of gypsy moth in western North America but, as yet (2000), neither strain is regarded as established there.
The North American experience with gypsy moth is an instructive case study of an invasive spe cies. There has been a well-documented public and scientific response to the problems caused by gypsy moth that can serve as a historical lesson for managing local and national environments in the global village. Scientific information on gypsy moth is probably as thorough as that on any invasive forest insect. Public policy on managing gypsy moth has ranged from neglect to aggressive mitigative action at considerable public cost and sometimes with dire environmental conse quences.
We can compare actions in the United States and Canada from distinct historical and legislative perspectives. As a case study in Canada, we can examine the impacts of establishment and spread of this alien species in eastern Canada and analyze the feasibility and benefits of maintaining gypsy moth-free regions by coordinating national and regional management activities. Discussion here emphasizes history and status of the European strain of gypsy moth now widely established in eastern North America and threatening to extend its range. Regulatory agencies now refer to this European strain as the North American gypsy moth, although it remains an alien species. Issues discussed here, however, pertain equally to the Asian strain of gypsy moth.
Attributes of an Invader
The gypsy moth has several biological and ecological attributes that favor its success as an invasive
species. Gypsy moth has a broad native geographic range that presents many potential sources of introduction. Also, the insect tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and feeds on many different tree species. Thus gypsy moth has a high probability of persistence in temperate forests worldwide. The reproductive biology of gypsy moth also favors colonization. Adult females may produce more than 1000 offspring in a single egg mass, so even one female can contribute a sizable founding population.
The greatest limitation of gypsy moth as an invasive species is that it is a poor disperser over long distances. The female adult moth of the European strain is flightless. Natural dispersal is restricted to relatively short distance ballooning of newly hatched larvae (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990), making gypsy moth’s surreptitious association with humans significant. Many of the host plants that gypsy moth favors flourish in habitats associated with human settlement. Further, gypsy moths frequently leave their host plants to lay eggs in sheltered locations and these are often structures associated with humans, such as firewood and outdoor household goods. When these goods are moved, the gypsy moth moves with them. Thus, although some spread of gypsy moth along the margins of its range in North America can be accounted for by natural dispersal of small larvae, inadvertent movement of egg masses, by a mobile human population, is the source of most new infestations in areas remote from the established populations, particularly those in western North America.

SC867,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

It took more than 25 years of research and development to bring Bt from first experimental use in the early 1960s into full operational use in the mid 1980s. Critical to this process was the adoption of HD-1 for commercial use, the standardization of formulations based on international units, and the development of higher potency products. An increase in product potency from 4 BIU/L in the early 1970s to 16.9 BIU/L in the mid 1980s, concomittant with improvements in formulation and application technology, reduced treatment costs while at the same time improving reliability of efficacy. A shift in political climate pushed Bt into operational use by 1985. Since then, Bt has been used in more than half of all spruce budworm control programs. The use of high-potency formulations (12.7 to 16.9 BIU/L) applied undiluted at 30 BIU in 2.4 L/ha or less has significantly reduced but not eliminated initial constraints of high treatment costs and inconsistent efficacy. Current research is focussed on further reducing these constraints. In the short term, registration of formulations containing 25 BIU/L or more is expected to permit application of reduced dosages in less than 1 L/ha and to clear the way for adoption of a split application scheme to increase reliability of efficacy.

SC909,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

We use hedonic modeling to evaluate the economic effects of Eurasian milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) invasions on lakefront property values of single-family homes in an urban-suburban landscape. Milfoil often forms dense canopies at the water surface, diminishing the value of ecosystem services (e.g., recreation, fishing) and necessitating expensive control and management efforts. We compare 1,258 lakeshore property sale transactions (1995–2006) in 17 lakes with milfoil and 24 un-invaded lakes in King County, Washington (USA). After accounting for structural (e.g., house size), locational (e.g., boat launch), and environmental characteristics (e.g., water clarity) of lakes, we found that milfoil has a significant negative effect on property sales price ($94,385 USD lower price), corresponding to a 19% decline in mean property values. The aggregate cost of milfoil invading one additional lake in the study area is, on average, $377,542 USD per year. Our study illustrates that invasive aquatic plants can significantly impact property values (and associated losses in property taxes that reduce local government revenue), justifying the need for management strategies that prevent and control invasions. We recommend coordinated efforts across Lake Management Districts to focus institutional support, funding, and outreach to prevent the introduction and spread of milfoil.

The objective of this study was to use sentinel chickens to evaluate whether adequate cleaning and disinfection coupled with an appropriate time period without susceptible poultry species on the premises would eliminate END virus from a noncommercial poultry operation and preclude the need for placement of sentinels in previously infected operations before declaring them free of virus. Noncommercial poultry operations were selected from the 2002 to 2003 END outbreak database. Operations included in the study had one or more isolations of END virus (ENDV) from cloacal or oropharyngeal swabs of birds on the premises. A total of 546 birds were placed on 53 premises. All sentinel birds sampled after placements were negative by virus detection methods and serologic tests. Results of this study indicate that time and the application of appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures will adequately mitigate the risk of viable virus persisting in noncommercial poultry operations.

SC944,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC971,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control.

SC979,TC,MarylandDNR2004,Potential Economic Losses Associated With Uncontrolled Nutria Populations in Maryland's Portion of the Chesapeake Bay,Maryland Department of Natural Resources,"Nutria (Myocaster coypus) are non-native aquatic mammals that are having an
unprecedented negative effect on the marshes and ecology of the Chesapeake Bay. Since
their introduction in the 1930's, nutria populations have continued to expand. With their
high reproductive rate and voracious appetite for marsh grasses and root mats, they are
now damaging hundreds of acres of valuable wetlands each year and turning oncevegetated
areas into mudflats and open-water. These denuded areas no longer provide
rich spawning and nursery grounds and habitat for the many species of shellfish, fish and
wildlife that this region is known for. Although the effects of nutria cannot be easily
separated from other detrimental factors, they are widely believed to be a large
contributing cause of the decline in the quality and extent of Chesapeake Bay wetlands.
As more and more acres of Chesapeake Bay marshes are lost, the resulting declines in
commercially and recreationally-valuable species takes a measurable economic toll on
the State ofMaiyland and its citizens. Commercial harvesting of shellfish and finfish,
sport hunting and fishing, and wildlife viewing in Maryland all have strong connections
to the wetlands of the Chesapeake and these sectors suffer as the marshes deteriorate. In
order to assess the economic effects this decline represents, this report analyzed scientific
literature, expert opinions and economic indices for commercial and recreational uses of
marshland and marsh-associated species in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay.
If marshes continue to be lost at the current rate, the financial losses to the State of
Maryland and its citizens are summarized in Table E-1 and E-2, below. In Table E-1, it
is clear that the direct losses due to declines in commercially and recreationally-valued
species alone are considerable annually and over the next 50 years. In Table E-2, it is
demonstrated that the losses in environmental services provided by wetlands, and the
associated social losses add another layer to the costs.   Taken together, the figures represented in Tables E-1 and E-2 present a challenge to the
State of Maryland and its citizens. These losses can be mitigated and lessened
considerably if marsh loss is slowed by removal of nutria. Otherwise, the economic
ramifications of damage to Chesapeake Bay marshes in the past and into the future are
costly and will continue to increase unless the necessary actions are taken. The costs of
nutria removal are potentially minor compared to the costs to the State if the loss of
marsh habitats continues unabated.",2004,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Myocastoridae,Myocastor,Myocastor coypus,,nutria,Aquatic,semi-aquatic,N,Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay; emergent wetlands,11,NA,North America,USA,Maryland,Chesapeake Bay,Unit (part of bay),"""current"" + ""2001"" ",Year,2001,2001,2001,2001,Potentially ongoing,541079,,,702174.49,702174.49,541079,702174.49,702174.49,USD,2004,Publication year,Observed,Report/Estimation,Public and social welfare,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,High,,,,,no,"Social losses in Table E2.

SC983,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1038,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1063,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

It took more than 25 years of research and development to bring Bt from first experimental use in the early 1960s into full operational use in the mid 1980s. Critical to this process was the adoption of HD-1 for commercial use, the standardization of formulations based on international units, and the development of higher potency products. An increase in product potency from 4 BIU/L in the early 1970s to 16.9 BIU/L in the mid 1980s, concomittant with improvements in formulation and application technology, reduced treatment costs while at the same time improving reliability of efficacy. A shift in political climate pushed Bt into operational use by 1985. Since then, Bt has been used in more than half of all spruce budworm control programs. The use of high-potency formulations (12.7 to 16.9 BIU/L) applied undiluted at 30 BIU in 2.4 L/ha or less has significantly reduced but not eliminated initial constraints of high treatment costs and inconsistent efficacy. Current research is focussed on further reducing these constraints. In the short term, registration of formulations containing 25 BIU/L or more is expected to permit application of reduced dosages in less than 1 L/ha and to clear the way for adoption of a split application scheme to increase reliability of efficacy.

SC1107,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1135,,Systma2007,Feral Swine Action Plan for Oregon.,"Systma, M, Rouhe, A","Feral swine are defined as free roaming animals of the genusSus that are notbeing held under domestic management or confinement.  Swine have spread from Europeand Russia to habitats around the world via human introduction. Currently, feral swine populations are established on every continent except Antarctica.  Unlike other large mammal invaders, swine have a high reproductive capacity and are omnivorous, which allows for a quick assimilation into most habitats.  Once a breeding population is established in an area, the population can quickly increase and negatively impact the ecosystem. A successful invasion of feral swine is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to reverse.  A feral swine pest risk assessment for Oregon, released in 2004, designated feral swine as a very high-risk species due to high potential for establishment, environmental and economic impacts, and disease transmission to wildlife, livestock and humans. Economic impacts on ecosystems and disease transmission to wildlife are difficult to assess, but restoration of ecosystems and losses to agriculture and livestock have been estimated to exceed US$800 million in the United States each year. Environmental impacts include facilitation of noxious weed invasions, shifts in dominant plant species, reduction of forest regeneration, and soil erosion.  Facilitation of noxious weeds and erosion due to feral swine rooting are documented in Oregon. Feral swine in Oregon have not been implicated in disease transmission to humans, but the recent E. coli outbreak from spinach grown on a California farm that caused three deaths has been genetically traced to feral swine excrement deposited in spinach fields. The feral swine population in Oregon is currently small and dispersed.  Few disturbances have been documented but state and federal biologists report regular occurrence of disturbances due to feral swine.  Actions to prevent the effects of an invasion fall into three categories: management, control or eradication. Of the three categories, only eradication efforts have successfully slowed or reversed the effects of swine invasions.

SC1142,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.

SC1143,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.

In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

guidance. Past eradication frameworks provide some useful criteria, but do not provide quantitative guidelines.
Here, we argue that eradication is not always adequately considered, and we develop a framework for
rapid assessment of its feasibility, despite limited data. This quantitative model offers criteria to rapidly
assess the potential for eradication and provide estimates of the necessary effort and timing, and of the size
of the target area. This framework is applied to a recent tunicate (Ciona intestinalis) invasion around Prince

SC1160,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.

SC1176,,Frasier2014,Economic Impact of Invasive Weed Species in Colorado: Phase I.,"Frasier, W. M.","For a number of years, the Colorado Weed Management Association (CWMA), an organization  comprised of weed managers representing government agencies, private and commercial  applicators, nonͲgovernmental organizations, and private citizens, has discussed the need to  document the economic impact of invasive weeds across the state of Colorado  (www.cwma.org). Although a variety of studies have been implemented in surrounding states,  even basic ColoradoͲspecific impacts have yet to be calculated. Phase I of this project addresses  this gap by leveraging a formed partnership between the Colorado Department of Agriculture,  Colorado Department of Natural Resources, CWMA, and Colorado State University to document  the basic economic impacts of a prioritized list of terrestrial and aquatic noxious weeds to the  State of Colorado.   Given the numerous and varied types of impacts of differential invasive species across the state  (including but not limited to agriculture, energy, infrastructure, natural resources, tourism, and  ecosystem services), this project is conceptualized as a sequence of interconnected yet  reasonably separate studies.

SC1185,,vanFrankenhuyzen1990,Development and current status of Bacillus thuringiensis for control of defoliating forest insects,van Frankenhuyzen,"Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a naturally occurring bacterium that is now widely used for control of spruce budworm and several other defoliating forest insects in Canada. It took more than 25 years of research and development to bring Bt from first experimental use in the early 1960s into full operational use in the mid 1980s. Critical to this process was the adoption of HD-1 for commercial use, the standardization of formulations based on international units, and the development of higher potency products. An increase in product potency from 4 BIU/L in the early 1970s to 16.9 BIU/L in the mid 1980s, concomittant with improvements in formulation and application technology, reduced treatment costs while at the same time improving reliability of efficacy. A shift in political climate pushed Bt into operational use by 1985. Since then, Bt has been used in more than half of all spruce budworm control programs. The use of high-potency formulations (12.7 to 16.9 BIU/L) applied undiluted at 30 BIU in 2.4 L/ha or less has significantly reduced but not eliminated initial constraints of high treatment costs and inconsistent efficacy. Current research is focussed on further reducing these constraints. In the short term, registration of formulations containing 25 BIU/L or more is expected to permit application of reduced dosages in less than 1 L/ha and to clear the way for adoption of a split application scheme to increase reliability of efficacy.

SC1187,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention.

SC1188,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

on developed land in communities in the analysis area. The simulations predict an expanding sudden oak
death (SOD) infestation that will likely encompass most of northwestern California and warrant treatment,
removal, and replacement of more than 10 thousand oak trees with discounted cost of $7.5 million.
In addition, we estimate the discounted property losses to single family homes of $135 million.
Expanding the land base to include developed land outside as well as inside communities doubles the
estimates of the number of oak trees killed and the associated costs and losses. The predicted costs and

SC1198,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

SC1209,,Panetta2009,Weed eradication - an economic perspective,"Panetta, FD","There has been recent interest in determining the upper limits to the feasibility of weed eradication. Although a number of disparate factors determine the success of an eradication program, ultimately eradication feasibility must be viewed in the context of the amount of investment that can be made. The latter should reflect the hazard posed by an invasion, with greater investment justified by greater threats. In simplest terms, the effort (and hence investment) to achieve weed eradication comprises the detection effort required to delimit an invasion plus the search and control effort required to prevent reproduction until extirpation occurs over the entire infested area. The difficulty of estimating the required investment at the commencement of a weed eradication program (as well as during periodic reviews) is a serious problem. Bioeconomics show promise in determining the optimal approach to managing weed invasions, notwithstanding ongoing difficulties in estimating the costs and benefits of eradication and alternative invasion management strategies. A flexible approach to the management of weed invasions is needed, allowing for the adoption of another strategy when it becomes clear that the probability of eradication is low, owing to resourcing or intractable technical issues. Whether the considerable progress that has been achieved towards eradication of the once massive witchweed invasion can be duplicated for other weeds of agricultural systems will depend to a large extent upon investment (. $250 million over 50 yr in this instance).

For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

It took more than 25 years of research and development to bring Bt from first experimental use in the early 1960s into full operational use in the mid 1980s. Critical to this process was the adoption of HD-1 for commercial use, the standardization of formulations based on international units, and the development of higher potency products. An increase in product potency from 4 BIU/L in the early 1970s to 16.9 BIU/L in the mid 1980s, concomittant with improvements in formulation and application technology, reduced treatment costs while at the same time improving reliability of efficacy. A shift in political climate pushed Bt into operational use by 1985. Since then, Bt has been used in more than half of all spruce budworm control programs. The use of high-potency formulations (12.7 to 16.9 BIU/L) applied undiluted at 30 BIU in 2.4 L/ha or less has significantly reduced but not eliminated initial constraints of high treatment costs and inconsistent efficacy. Current research is focussed on further reducing these constraints. In the short term, registration of formulations containing 25 BIU/L or more is expected to permit application of reduced dosages in less than 1 L/ha and to clear the way for adoption of a split application scheme to increase reliability of efficacy.

SC1221,,Frasier2014,Economic Impact of Invasive Weed Species in Colorado: Phase I.,"Frasier, W. M.","For a number of years, the Colorado Weed Management Association (CWMA), an organization  comprised of weed managers representing government agencies, private and commercial  applicators, nonͲgovernmental organizations, and private citizens, has discussed the need to  document the economic impact of invasive weeds across the state of Colorado  (www.cwma.org). Although a variety of studies have been implemented in surrounding states,  even basic ColoradoͲspecific impacts have yet to be calculated. Phase I of this project addresses  this gap by leveraging a formed partnership between the Colorado Department of Agriculture,  Colorado Department of Natural Resources, CWMA, and Colorado State University to document  the basic economic impacts of a prioritized list of terrestrial and aquatic noxious weeds to the  State of Colorado.   Given the numerous and varied types of impacts of differential invasive species across the state  (including but not limited to agriculture, energy, infrastructure, natural resources, tourism, and  ecosystem services), this project is conceptualized as a sequence of interconnected yet  reasonably separate studies.

SC1222,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one.

Kanney, Jesse D. Roberts, and David P. Groeneveld","Major beneﬁts were weighed against major costs associated with recent saltcedar control efforts along the Middle Pecos River, New Mexico. The area of study was restricted to both sides of the channel and excluded tributaries along the 370 km between Sumner and Brantley dams. Direct costs (helicopter spraying, dead tree removal, and revegetation) within the study area were estimated to be $2.2 million but possibly rising to $6.4 million with the adoption of an aggressive revegetation program. Indirect costs associated with increased potential for erosion and reservoir sedimentation would raise the costs due to increased evaporation from more extensive shallows in the Pecos River as it enters Brantley Reservoir. Actions such as dredging are unlikely given the conservative amount of sediment calculated (about 1% of the reservoir pool). The potential for water salvage was identiﬁed as the only tangible beneﬁt likely to be realized under the current control strategy. Estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) using Landsat TM data allowed estimation of potential water salvage as the difference in ET before and after treatment, an amount totaling 7.41 million m3 (6010 acre-ft) per year. Previous saltcedar control efforts of roughly the same magnitude found that salvaged ET recharged groundwater and no additional ﬂows were realized within the river. Thus, the value of this recharge is probably less than the lowest value quoted for actual in-channel ﬂow, and estimated to be\$63,000 per year. Though couched in terms of costs and beneﬁts, this paper is focused on what can be considered the key trade-off under a complete eradication strategy: water salvage vs. erosion and sedimentation. It differs from previous efforts by focusing on evaluating the impacts of actual control efforts within a speciﬁc system. Total costs (direct plus potential indirect) far outweighed beneﬁts in this simple comparison and are expected to be ongoing. Problems induced by saltcedar control may permanently reduce reservoir capacity and increase reservoir evaporation rates, which could further deplete supplies on this water short system.

SC1230,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1273,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1303,,Nealis2002,"Gypsy moth in Canada: case study of an invasive insect. Pages 151-159 in Claudi et al. (2002) Alien Invaders in Canada's Water, Wetlands, and Forests",Nealis V.G.,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L.)) is a native insect of Eurasia where it feeds on the leaves of broadleaf trees, especially oaks (Quercus spp.). Populations of gypsy moth increase periodically to very high local densities and severely defoliate preferred host trees (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990). In its native range, gypsy moth displays highly variable biological characteristics. The most significant life-history variations relevant to invasiveness are the geographic differences in flight capability of adult females and host food range of the larvae. Female moths from western (European) populations are flightless, while those from eastern (Asian) populations are capable of strong, directed flight. Gypsy moth larvae feed on a wide variety of mostly broadleaf tree hosts throughout their geographic range, but Asian populations also feed on coniferous tree species and therefore are of even greater concern to Canada than the European populations.
A European strain of the gypsy moth escaped from a laboratory near Boston, MA, in 1869. Since then, gypsy moth has spread and become established in the temperate forests of eastern North America, approximately between latitudes 36° and 47°N, and from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes basin as far as 90°W. During this same period, there have been repeated interceptions of both European and Asian strains of gypsy moth in western North America but, as yet (2000), neither strain is regarded as established there.
The North American experience with gypsy moth is an instructive case study of an invasive spe cies. There has been a well-documented public and scientific response to the problems caused by gypsy moth that can serve as a historical lesson for managing local and national environments in the global village. Scientific information on gypsy moth is probably as thorough as that on any invasive forest insect. Public policy on managing gypsy moth has ranged from neglect to aggressive mitigative action at considerable public cost and sometimes with dire environmental conse quences.
We can compare actions in the United States and Canada from distinct historical and legislative perspectives. As a case study in Canada, we can examine the impacts of establishment and spread of this alien species in eastern Canada and analyze the feasibility and benefits of maintaining gypsy moth-free regions by coordinating national and regional management activities. Discussion here emphasizes history and status of the European strain of gypsy moth now widely established in eastern North America and threatening to extend its range. Regulatory agencies now refer to this European strain as the North American gypsy moth, although it remains an alien species. Issues discussed here, however, pertain equally to the Asian strain of gypsy moth.
Attributes of an Invader
The gypsy moth has several biological and ecological attributes that favor its success as an invasive
species. Gypsy moth has a broad native geographic range that presents many potential sources of introduction. Also, the insect tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and feeds on many different tree species. Thus gypsy moth has a high probability of persistence in temperate forests worldwide. The reproductive biology of gypsy moth also favors colonization. Adult females may produce more than 1000 offspring in a single egg mass, so even one female can contribute a sizable founding population.
The greatest limitation of gypsy moth as an invasive species is that it is a poor disperser over long distances. The female adult moth of the European strain is flightless. Natural dispersal is restricted to relatively short distance ballooning of newly hatched larvae (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990), making gypsy moth’s surreptitious association with humans significant. Many of the host plants that gypsy moth favors flourish in habitats associated with human settlement. Further, gypsy moths frequently leave their host plants to lay eggs in sheltered locations and these are often structures associated with humans, such as firewood and outdoor household goods. When these goods are moved, the gypsy moth moves with them. Thus, although some spread of gypsy moth along the margins of its range in North America can be accounted for by natural dispersal of small larvae, inadvertent movement of egg masses, by a mobile human population, is the source of most new infestations in areas remote from the established populations, particularly those in western North America.

Additional savings have accrued through increased productivity of pastures ($1.27 million/year) and by reducing herbicide use ($0.85 million/year). Control of ragwort was achieved at a cost of about $5/ha. Non-market benefits include return of desirable flora in habitats once dominated by ragwort and a reduction in herbicide in the environment. Several correlative observations substantiate evidence used in estimating benefits of the regional control of ragwort. In western Oregon, control of ragwort reduced propagule production, which correlated with a decline in the number of new infestations in eastern Oregon, despite increased detection efforts.

We   estimated   hydropower   maintenance   costs   associated   with   zebra   mussels   by   examining  the  Bonneville  Dam  First  Powerhouse,  costs  associated  with  Asian  clam  (Corbicula fluminea) control at Bonneville, and a survey of zebra mussel mitigation costs at other hydropower generation facilities in North America. We   found   that   the   one-time   cost   for   installing   zebra   mussel   control   systems   at   hydroelectric  projects  could  range  from  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  to  over  a  million dollars per facility.  The estimated cost for a hypothetical zebra mussel mitigation strategy,  based  upon  two  response  scenarios  (a  sodium  hypochlorite  (NaOCl)  injection  system and anti-fouling paint), at 13 select hydroelectric projects, was $23,621,000.  The cost per generator was $62,599 for the NaOCl system, and $81,000 for antifouling paint (not including labor).  Removal, painting, sandblasting and installation could potentially double antifouling paint treatment costs.  We estimated that if a NaOCl system was installed at an “average” size Columbia River Basin facility, assuming intermittent use, annual operating costs would likely not exceed $100,000.    Operating  costs  will  vary  depending  on  the  facility,  degree  of  infestation,  environmental permits, etc. This  investigation  found  that  once  utilities  initiate  long-term  mussel  control  programs,  they usually become part of routine maintenance at annual, biennial, or longer intervals, depending on how rapidly the mussels recolonize the systems.   A detailed management plan is needed to determine the best zebra mussel mitigation and control strategy for the FCRPS. The management plan should detail key agency contacts and  coordination;  control  technologies;  permit  requirements;  costs  for  the  hydroelectric  and nuclear facilities, transportation, upstream and downstream fish passage system; and the  environmental  impacts  of  likely  mitigation  technologies.

SC1349,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1357,,Nealis2002,"Gypsy moth in Canada: case study of an invasive insect. Pages 151-159 in Claudi et al. (2002) Alien Invaders in Canada's Water, Wetlands, and Forests",Nealis V.G.,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L.)) is a native insect of Eurasia where it feeds on the leaves of broadleaf trees, especially oaks (Quercus spp.). Populations of gypsy moth increase periodically to very high local densities and severely defoliate preferred host trees (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990). In its native range, gypsy moth displays highly variable biological characteristics. The most significant life-history variations relevant to invasiveness are the geographic differences in flight capability of adult females and host food range of the larvae. Female moths from western (European) populations are flightless, while those from eastern (Asian) populations are capable of strong, directed flight. Gypsy moth larvae feed on a wide variety of mostly broadleaf tree hosts throughout their geographic range, but Asian populations also feed on coniferous tree species and therefore are of even greater concern to Canada than the European populations.
A European strain of the gypsy moth escaped from a laboratory near Boston, MA, in 1869. Since then, gypsy moth has spread and become established in the temperate forests of eastern North America, approximately between latitudes 36° and 47°N, and from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes basin as far as 90°W. During this same period, there have been repeated interceptions of both European and Asian strains of gypsy moth in western North America but, as yet (2000), neither strain is regarded as established there.
The North American experience with gypsy moth is an instructive case study of an invasive spe cies. There has been a well-documented public and scientific response to the problems caused by gypsy moth that can serve as a historical lesson for managing local and national environments in the global village. Scientific information on gypsy moth is probably as thorough as that on any invasive forest insect. Public policy on managing gypsy moth has ranged from neglect to aggressive mitigative action at considerable public cost and sometimes with dire environmental conse quences.
We can compare actions in the United States and Canada from distinct historical and legislative perspectives. As a case study in Canada, we can examine the impacts of establishment and spread of this alien species in eastern Canada and analyze the feasibility and benefits of maintaining gypsy moth-free regions by coordinating national and regional management activities. Discussion here emphasizes history and status of the European strain of gypsy moth now widely established in eastern North America and threatening to extend its range. Regulatory agencies now refer to this European strain as the North American gypsy moth, although it remains an alien species. Issues discussed here, however, pertain equally to the Asian strain of gypsy moth.
Attributes of an Invader
The gypsy moth has several biological and ecological attributes that favor its success as an invasive
species. Gypsy moth has a broad native geographic range that presents many potential sources of introduction. Also, the insect tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and feeds on many different tree species. Thus gypsy moth has a high probability of persistence in temperate forests worldwide. The reproductive biology of gypsy moth also favors colonization. Adult females may produce more than 1000 offspring in a single egg mass, so even one female can contribute a sizable founding population.
The greatest limitation of gypsy moth as an invasive species is that it is a poor disperser over long distances. The female adult moth of the European strain is flightless. Natural dispersal is restricted to relatively short distance ballooning of newly hatched larvae (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990), making gypsy moth’s surreptitious association with humans significant. Many of the host plants that gypsy moth favors flourish in habitats associated with human settlement. Further, gypsy moths frequently leave their host plants to lay eggs in sheltered locations and these are often structures associated with humans, such as firewood and outdoor household goods. When these goods are moved, the gypsy moth moves with them. Thus, although some spread of gypsy moth along the margins of its range in North America can be accounted for by natural dispersal of small larvae, inadvertent movement of egg masses, by a mobile human population, is the source of most new infestations in areas remote from the established populations, particularly those in western North America.

It took more than 25 years of research and development to bring Bt from first experimental use in the early 1960s into full operational use in the mid 1980s. Critical to this process was the adoption of HD-1 for commercial use, the standardization of formulations based on international units, and the development of higher potency products. An increase in product potency from 4 BIU/L in the early 1970s to 16.9 BIU/L in the mid 1980s, concomittant with improvements in formulation and application technology, reduced treatment costs while at the same time improving reliability of efficacy. A shift in political climate pushed Bt into operational use by 1985. Since then, Bt has been used in more than half of all spruce budworm control programs. The use of high-potency formulations (12.7 to 16.9 BIU/L) applied undiluted at 30 BIU in 2.4 L/ha or less has significantly reduced but not eliminated initial constraints of high treatment costs and inconsistent efficacy. Current research is focussed on further reducing these constraints. In the short term, registration of formulations containing 25 BIU/L or more is expected to permit application of reduced dosages in less than 1 L/ha and to clear the way for adoption of a split application scheme to increase reliability of efficacy.

SC1366,TC,MarylandDNR2004,Potential Economic Losses Associated With Uncontrolled Nutria Populations in Maryland's Portion of the Chesapeake Bay,Maryland Department of Natural Resources,"Nutria (Myocaster coypus) are non-native aquatic mammals that are having an
unprecedented negative effect on the marshes and ecology of the Chesapeake Bay. Since
their introduction in the 1930's, nutria populations have continued to expand. With their
high reproductive rate and voracious appetite for marsh grasses and root mats, they are
now damaging hundreds of acres of valuable wetlands each year and turning oncevegetated
areas into mudflats and open-water. These denuded areas no longer provide
rich spawning and nursery grounds and habitat for the many species of shellfish, fish and
wildlife that this region is known for. Although the effects of nutria cannot be easily
separated from other detrimental factors, they are widely believed to be a large
contributing cause of the decline in the quality and extent of Chesapeake Bay wetlands.
As more and more acres of Chesapeake Bay marshes are lost, the resulting declines in
commercially and recreationally-valuable species takes a measurable economic toll on
the State ofMaiyland and its citizens. Commercial harvesting of shellfish and finfish,
sport hunting and fishing, and wildlife viewing in Maryland all have strong connections
to the wetlands of the Chesapeake and these sectors suffer as the marshes deteriorate. In
order to assess the economic effects this decline represents, this report analyzed scientific
literature, expert opinions and economic indices for commercial and recreational uses of
marshland and marsh-associated species in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay.
If marshes continue to be lost at the current rate, the financial losses to the State of
Maryland and its citizens are summarized in Table E-1 and E-2, below. In Table E-1, it
is clear that the direct losses due to declines in commercially and recreationally-valued
species alone are considerable annually and over the next 50 years. In Table E-2, it is
demonstrated that the losses in environmental services provided by wetlands, and the
associated social losses add another layer to the costs.   Taken together, the figures represented in Tables E-1 and E-2 present a challenge to the
State of Maryland and its citizens. These losses can be mitigated and lessened
considerably if marsh loss is slowed by removal of nutria. Otherwise, the economic
ramifications of damage to Chesapeake Bay marshes in the past and into the future are
costly and will continue to increase unless the necessary actions are taken. The costs of
nutria removal are potentially minor compared to the costs to the State if the loss of
marsh habitats continues unabated.",2004,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Myocastoridae,Myocastor,Myocastor coypus,,nutria,Aquatic,semi-aquatic,N,Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay; emergent wetlands,11,NA,North America,USA,Maryland,Chesapeake Bay,Unit (part of bay),"""current"" + ""2001"" ",Year,2001,2001,2001,2001,Potentially ongoing,5147780,NA,NA,6680428.95,6680428.95,5147780,6680428.95,6680428.95,USD,2004,Publication year,Observed,Report/Estimation,Fishery/Public and social welfare,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,High,,,,,no,"Sum of ""current annual losses"" from Table E1.

Models of leafy spurge patch expansion, infestation and grazing carrying capacity, infestation and wildlife habitat, and wildlife and wildlands were developed. Leafy spurge infestation results in an estimated direct annual impact of $40.5 million in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.

SC1371,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

These nonnative plants and animals have an adverse impact on Washington’s landscapes, ecosystems, agriculture, commerce and recreation. This report aims to help state agencies tasked with managing natural resources to quantify the potential economic damages of a select list of twenty-three invasive species on the overall Washington economy, coupled with a broader understanding as to how these damages translate into lost jobs, lost wages, and lost business sales (or output). Total Costs of Invasive Species Crops: Cropland has the potential to be quickly infested by invasive plants, which reduce overall yields and require resources for their control. Furthermore, crops are directly lost through invasive animal consumption. The direct impact of invasive species on crops grown in Washington is estimated to be $239.5 million per year. Livestock: Invasive noxious weeds in pastures and rangeland displace desirable forage that help sustain livestock. In some cases, these plants are also toxic to livestock and horses and can be fatal. The direct economic impact of invasive species on the livestock industry is estimated to be $120.1 million annually. Timber: Many invasive species can severely impact Washington’s $1.68 billion timber and logging industry. Invasive noxious weed species such as Scotch broom can outcompete new saplings, which reduces future timber harvests. Insect species such as the gypsy moth have a more immediate impact on the timber industry by defoliating and stressing, resulting in mortality of adult trees. The direct economic impact of invasive species on the timber industry is estimated to be $124.8 million. Recreation: Recreational activities such as hunting, fishing, and boating can all be adversely affected by invasive species. Many of the same species that impact a rancher’s ability to range their cattle also reduce elk and deer populations. Aquatic invasive species can cause declines in fish populations and reduce access to popular fishing areas. Other aquatic species can clog up boat propellers and render public boat launches unusable. The direct economic impact to recreational activities from invasive species is estimated to be $20.5 million per year. Most Costly Invasive Species Plant Species Rush skeletonweed has an extensive root system that allows it to outcompete native grasses and valuable crops for water. Major crops impacted include wheat and potatoes, both of which are major commodities in Washington. It has the potential to have a total economic impact of $149.2 million, putting 1,080 jobs at risk if it were allowed to spread an additional 12% per year into susceptible land types. Scotch broom quickly forms dense stands which quickly outcompete young trees and desirable forage plants. Furthermore, Scotch broom can be toxic to cattle. Scotch broom is widespread in western Washington and has the potential to cause a total of $142.7 million in lost sales and 660 job losses in Washington per year if it were allowed to spread an additional 12% per year into susceptible land types. Animal Species: Apple maggots infest apple, pear and cherry orchards, rendering significant numbers of fruit unsuitable for sale. Since apple maggot is an invasive species, any orchard infested with apple maggot cannot export any of its fruit without undergoing treatment. The total economic impact from apple maggot is estimated to be $392.5 million, putting 2,900 jobs at risk per year. Zebra mussels are not currently found in Washington but do have the potential to infest numerous bodies of water in the Columbia River Basin. Zebra mussels can clog intake valves in dams as well as colonize public boat launches, rendering them unusable. If zebra mussels were to establish in Washington, the economic impact could be as large as $100.1 million.

It took more than 25 years of research and development to bring Bt from first experimental use in the early 1960s into full operational use in the mid 1980s. Critical to this process was the adoption of HD-1 for commercial use, the standardization of formulations based on international units, and the development of higher potency products. An increase in product potency from 4 BIU/L in the early 1970s to 16.9 BIU/L in the mid 1980s, concomittant with improvements in formulation and application technology, reduced treatment costs while at the same time improving reliability of efficacy. A shift in political climate pushed Bt into operational use by 1985. Since then, Bt has been used in more than half of all spruce budworm control programs. The use of high-potency formulations (12.7 to 16.9 BIU/L) applied undiluted at 30 BIU in 2.4 L/ha or less has significantly reduced but not eliminated initial constraints of high treatment costs and inconsistent efficacy. Current research is focussed on further reducing these constraints. In the short term, registration of formulations containing 25 BIU/L or more is expected to permit application of reduced dosages in less than 1 L/ha and to clear the way for adoption of a split application scheme to increase reliability of efficacy.

SC1396,,Nealis2002,"Gypsy moth in Canada: case study of an invasive insect. Pages 151-159 in Claudi et al. (2002) Alien Invaders in Canada's Water, Wetlands, and Forests",Nealis V.G.,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L.)) is a native insect of Eurasia where it feeds on the leaves of broadleaf trees, especially oaks (Quercus spp.). Populations of gypsy moth increase periodically to very high local densities and severely defoliate preferred host trees (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990). In its native range, gypsy moth displays highly variable biological characteristics. The most significant life-history variations relevant to invasiveness are the geographic differences in flight capability of adult females and host food range of the larvae. Female moths from western (European) populations are flightless, while those from eastern (Asian) populations are capable of strong, directed flight. Gypsy moth larvae feed on a wide variety of mostly broadleaf tree hosts throughout their geographic range, but Asian populations also feed on coniferous tree species and therefore are of even greater concern to Canada than the European populations.
A European strain of the gypsy moth escaped from a laboratory near Boston, MA, in 1869. Since then, gypsy moth has spread and become established in the temperate forests of eastern North America, approximately between latitudes 36° and 47°N, and from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes basin as far as 90°W. During this same period, there have been repeated interceptions of both European and Asian strains of gypsy moth in western North America but, as yet (2000), neither strain is regarded as established there.
The North American experience with gypsy moth is an instructive case study of an invasive spe cies. There has been a well-documented public and scientific response to the problems caused by gypsy moth that can serve as a historical lesson for managing local and national environments in the global village. Scientific information on gypsy moth is probably as thorough as that on any invasive forest insect. Public policy on managing gypsy moth has ranged from neglect to aggressive mitigative action at considerable public cost and sometimes with dire environmental conse quences.
We can compare actions in the United States and Canada from distinct historical and legislative perspectives. As a case study in Canada, we can examine the impacts of establishment and spread of this alien species in eastern Canada and analyze the feasibility and benefits of maintaining gypsy moth-free regions by coordinating national and regional management activities. Discussion here emphasizes history and status of the European strain of gypsy moth now widely established in eastern North America and threatening to extend its range. Regulatory agencies now refer to this European strain as the North American gypsy moth, although it remains an alien species. Issues discussed here, however, pertain equally to the Asian strain of gypsy moth.
Attributes of an Invader
The gypsy moth has several biological and ecological attributes that favor its success as an invasive
species. Gypsy moth has a broad native geographic range that presents many potential sources of introduction. Also, the insect tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and feeds on many different tree species. Thus gypsy moth has a high probability of persistence in temperate forests worldwide. The reproductive biology of gypsy moth also favors colonization. Adult females may produce more than 1000 offspring in a single egg mass, so even one female can contribute a sizable founding population.
The greatest limitation of gypsy moth as an invasive species is that it is a poor disperser over long distances. The female adult moth of the European strain is flightless. Natural dispersal is restricted to relatively short distance ballooning of newly hatched larvae (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990), making gypsy moth’s surreptitious association with humans significant. Many of the host plants that gypsy moth favors flourish in habitats associated with human settlement. Further, gypsy moths frequently leave their host plants to lay eggs in sheltered locations and these are often structures associated with humans, such as firewood and outdoor household goods. When these goods are moved, the gypsy moth moves with them. Thus, although some spread of gypsy moth along the margins of its range in North America can be accounted for by natural dispersal of small larvae, inadvertent movement of egg masses, by a mobile human population, is the source of most new infestations in areas remote from the established populations, particularly those in western North America.

SC1405,,FLDEP2007,Status of the Aquatic Plant Maintenance Program in Florida Public Waters Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2006 - 2007,Florida Department of Environmental Protection,"This report was prepared in accordance with §369.22 (7), Florida Statutes, to provide an annual assessment of the control achieved and funding necessary to manage nonindigenous aquatic plants in intercounty waters. The authority of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) as addressed in §369.20 (5), Florida Statutes, extends to the management of nuisance populations of all aquatic plants, both indigenous and nonindigenous, and in all waters accessible to the general public. The aquatic plant management program in Florida’s public waters involves complex operational and financial interactions between state, federal and local governments as well as private sector companies. A summary of plant acres controlled in sovereignty public waters and associated expenditures contracted or monitored by the DEP during Fiscal Year 2006-2007 is presented in the tables on page 42 of this report. Florida’s aquatic plant management program mission is to reduce negative impacts from invasive nonindigenous plants like water hyacinth, water lettuce and hydrilla to conserve the multiple uses and functions of public lakes and rivers. Invasive plants infest 95 percent of the 437 public waters inventoried in 2007 that comprise 1.25 million acres of fresh water where fishing alone is valued at more than $1.5 billion annually. Once established, eradicating invasive plants is difficult or impossible and very expensive; therefore, continuous maintenance is critical to sustaining navigation, flood control and recreation while conserving native plant habitat on sovereignty state lands at the lowest feasible cost. The floating, non-native water hyacinth and water lettuce are two of the world’s fastest growing plants. These invasive plants, that once covered more than 125,000 acres of Florida’s public waters, are the DEP’s highest management priority. Floating plants covered a combined 3,342 acres in the 247 waters in which they were detected during 2007 - a 2,200-acre reduction from 2006 and an 11,000-acre reduction since 2005. About $3.5 million were spent controlling nearly 21,900 acres of floating plants in FY 06-07. Ninety-eight percent of Florida’s public waters are under maintenance control in regards to invasive floating plants. Efforts are underway to bring remaining systems like Lake Monroe, Shell Reservoir and the St. Johns, Hillsborough and Withlacoochee Rivers under control. Hydrilla, a submersed invasive species introduced from Southeast Asia in the 1950s, dispersed throughout the state impacting nearly 140,000 acres by the early 1990s. Dense mats form at the water surface blocking navigation, jamming against bridges, starving fish of oxygen and hampering flood control. Increased control efforts from improved, recurring funds since 2000, along with wave action and increased turbidity from three hurricanes in 2004, reduced the hydrilla standing crop to 20,400 in 2005. However, underground tubers that can sprout and blanket waters within one year still infest an estimated 81,400 acres. Hydrilla, which has been recorded in as many as 346 public water bodies during the previous 24 years, was detected in 199 waters in 2007. Hydrilla cover increased to about 45,400 acres in 2007. It is considered to be under maintenance control in 96 percent of Florida’s public waters. However, hydrilla is continuing a rapid recovery from the post hurricane year low, expanding in some of Florida’s largest and most important lakes including Toho, Orange, Lochloosa and Rousseau. Approximately $6.8 million were spent managing 13,569 acres of hydrilla in public waters in FY 06-07. This low effort of control is more reflective of the lack of costeffective, large-scale management tools available since the confirmation of increasing resistance to fluridone herbicide in hydrilla. Intense research and operational efforts during the past six years have lead to the development of new strategies that will be employed in an expanded level of hydrilla management in FY 07-08. Nine additional invasive plants collectively infest 88 percent of Florida’s public waters covering about 19,000 acres. More than $5.8 million were spent managing other plants in FY 06-07, including invasive exotics as well as native plants that interfered with uses and functions of Florida public waters. Approximately $29.7 million are needed for FY 08-09 to manage invasive exotic aquatic plants; $18 million to sustain current control levels and improve upon hydrilla maintenance strategies; $3.5 million to control floating plants; and $8.2 million to manage other invasive plants, especially torpedograss, in Florida public waters",2007,English,Official report,Adams2011,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Alismatales,Hydrocharitaceae,Hydrilla,Hydrilla verticillata,,hydrilla,Aquatic,aquatic,N,NA,NA,N,North America,USA,,Florida,Site,2007,Year,2007,2007,2007,2007,One-time,6809970,,,8050726.12,8050726.12,6809970,8050726.12,8050726.12,USD,2007,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Control/Management,Management_costs,Post-invasion_management,High,,,,,yes,,Jean Fantle-Lepczyk,

SC1419,,Panetta2009,Weed eradication - an economic perspective,"Panetta, FD","There has been recent interest in determining the upper limits to the feasibility of weed eradication. Although a number of disparate factors determine the success of an eradication program, ultimately eradication feasibility must be viewed in the context of the amount of investment that can be made. The latter should reflect the hazard posed by an invasion, with greater investment justified by greater threats. In simplest terms, the effort (and hence investment) to achieve weed eradication comprises the detection effort required to delimit an invasion plus the search and control effort required to prevent reproduction until extirpation occurs over the entire infested area. The difficulty of estimating the required investment at the commencement of a weed eradication program (as well as during periodic reviews) is a serious problem. Bioeconomics show promise in determining the optimal approach to managing weed invasions, notwithstanding ongoing difficulties in estimating the costs and benefits of eradication and alternative invasion management strategies. A flexible approach to the management of weed invasions is needed, allowing for the adoption of another strategy when it becomes clear that the probability of eradication is low, owing to resourcing or intractable technical issues. Whether the considerable progress that has been achieved towards eradication of the once massive witchweed invasion can be duplicated for other weeds of agricultural systems will depend to a large extent upon investment (. $250 million over 50 yr in this instance).

SC1437,,vanFrankenhuyzen1990,Development and current status of Bacillus thuringiensis for control of defoliating forest insects,van Frankenhuyzen,"Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a naturally occurring bacterium that is now widely used for control of spruce budworm and several other defoliating forest insects in Canada. It took more than 25 years of research and development to bring Bt from first experimental use in the early 1960s into full operational use in the mid 1980s. Critical to this process was the adoption of HD-1 for commercial use, the standardization of formulations based on international units, and the development of higher potency products. An increase in product potency from 4 BIU/L in the early 1970s to 16.9 BIU/L in the mid 1980s, concomittant with improvements in formulation and application technology, reduced treatment costs while at the same time improving reliability of efficacy. A shift in political climate pushed Bt into operational use by 1985. Since then, Bt has been used in more than half of all spruce budworm control programs. The use of high-potency formulations (12.7 to 16.9 BIU/L) applied undiluted at 30 BIU in 2.4 L/ha or less has significantly reduced but not eliminated initial constraints of high treatment costs and inconsistent efficacy. Current research is focussed on further reducing these constraints. In the short term, registration of formulations containing 25 BIU/L or more is expected to permit application of reduced dosages in less than 1 L/ha and to clear the way for adoption of a split application scheme to increase reliability of efficacy.

SC1438,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.

standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

It took more than 25 years of research and development to bring Bt from first experimental use in the early 1960s into full operational use in the mid 1980s. Critical to this process was the adoption of HD-1 for commercial use, the standardization of formulations based on international units, and the development of higher potency products. An increase in product potency from 4 BIU/L in the early 1970s to 16.9 BIU/L in the mid 1980s, concomittant with improvements in formulation and application technology, reduced treatment costs while at the same time improving reliability of efficacy.

The use of high-potency formulations (12.7 to 16.9 BIU/L) applied undiluted at 30 BIU in 2.4 L/ha or less has significantly reduced but not eliminated initial constraints of high treatment costs and inconsistent efficacy. Current research is focussed on further reducing these constraints.

SC1443,,FLDEP2006,Status of the Aquatic Plant Maintenance Program in Florida Public Waters Annual Report Fiscal Year 2005-2006,Florida Department of Environmental Protection,"Florida’s aquatic plant management program mission is to reduce negative impacts from invasive non-indigenous plants like water hyacinth, water lettuce, and hydrilla, as well as nuisance native plants, including floating islands that jeopardize navigation, bridges, and flood control structures. Invasive plants infest 96% of the 445 public lakes and rivers inventoried in 2006 that comprise 1.26 million acres of fresh water where fishing alone is valued at over $1.5 billion annually. Once established, eradicating invasive plants is difficult or impossible and very expensive; therefore, continuous maintenance is critical to sustaining navigation, flood control, and recreation while conserving native plant habitat on sovereignty state lands, at the lowest feasible cost. The floating, non-native water hyacinth and water lettuce are two of the world’s fastest growing plants. These invasive plants, that once covered more than 125,000 acres of Florida’s public waters, are the BIPM’s highest management priority. Floating plants covered 5,580 acres in the 276 waters in which they were detected during 2006; an 8,800- acre reduction from 2005. 99% of Florida’s public waters are under maintenance control in regards to invasive floating plants. About $3.6 million were spent controlling nearly 37,100 acres of floating plants in FY 05-06. 81% of the floating plant coverage was in Lake Okeechobee and the St Johns and Kissimmee Rivers and their tributaries. Intensive management efforts are underway to bring these systems under control. Hydrilla, a submersed invasive species introduced from Southeast Asia in the 1950s, dispersed throughout the state impacting nearly 140,000 acres by the early 1990s. Dense mats form at the water surface blocking navigation, jamming against bridges, starving fish of oxygen, and hampering flood control. Increased control efforts from improved, recurring funds under the Florida Forever Act, along with wave action and increased turbidity from three hurricanes in 2004 reduced the hydrilla standing crop to 20,409 in 2005 - the lowest level since the BIPM began conducting inventories in 1983. However, underground tubers that can sprout and blanket waters within one year, still infest an estimated 91,000 acres. Hydrilla, which has been recorded in as many as 346 public water bodies during the previous 23 years, was detected in 202 waters in 2006. Hydrilla cover increased to about 31,800 acres in 2006; however, hydrilla is considered to be under maintenance control in 96% of Florida’s public waters. Approximately $8.5 million were spent managing 17,800 acres of hydrilla in public waters in FY 05-06. These figures represent an increase of about 20% in the acres controlled and 15% in control expenditures over the previous year reflecting the recovery from 2004 hurricane-related disturbances. As water levels dropped and water clarity improved, hydrilla began to recover, requiring increasing statewide maintenance efforts. Nine additional invasive plants collectively infest 85% of Florida’s public waters covering about 18,200 acres. More than $9.1 million were spent managing other plants in FY 05-06, including invasive exotics as well as rooted native plants that interfered with uses and functions of Florida public waters. Floating islands generated from increased water levels and hurricanes in the early 2000s created problems with navigation, flood control, recreation, habitat and even human safety. $8.6 million were spent controlling floating islands in both FY 04-05 and FY 05-06. This intensive management combined with receding water levels in the latter half of 2006 have substantially reduced floating island-related problems as well as the funding required to manage them. Approximately $29.0 million are needed for FY 07-08 to manage invasive exotic aquatic plants and floating islands; $16 million to sustain control and improve upon hydrilla maintenance strategies; $3.5 million to control floating plants; and $9.5 million to manage other invasive plants including drifting, floating islands in Florida public waters.",2006,English,Official report,Adams2011,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Alismatales,Hydrocharitaceae,Hydrilla,Hydrilla verticillata,,hydrilla,Aquatic,aquatic,N,NA,NA,N,North America,USA,,Florida,Site,2006,Year,2006,2006,2006,2006,One-time,8500946,,,10336480.55,10336480.55,8500946,10336480.55,10336480.55,USD,2006,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Control/Management,Management_costs,Post-invasion_management,High,,,,,yes,,Jean Fantle-Lepczyk,

SC1456,TC,MarylandDNR2004,Potential Economic Losses Associated With Uncontrolled Nutria Populations in Maryland's Portion of the Chesapeake Bay,Maryland Department of Natural Resources,"Nutria (Myocaster coypus) are non-native aquatic mammals that are having an
unprecedented negative effect on the marshes and ecology of the Chesapeake Bay. Since
their introduction in the 1930's, nutria populations have continued to expand. With their
high reproductive rate and voracious appetite for marsh grasses and root mats, they are
now damaging hundreds of acres of valuable wetlands each year and turning oncevegetated
areas into mudflats and open-water. These denuded areas no longer provide
rich spawning and nursery grounds and habitat for the many species of shellfish, fish and
wildlife that this region is known for. Although the effects of nutria cannot be easily
separated from other detrimental factors, they are widely believed to be a large
contributing cause of the decline in the quality and extent of Chesapeake Bay wetlands.
As more and more acres of Chesapeake Bay marshes are lost, the resulting declines in
commercially and recreationally-valuable species takes a measurable economic toll on
the State ofMaiyland and its citizens. Commercial harvesting of shellfish and finfish,
sport hunting and fishing, and wildlife viewing in Maryland all have strong connections
to the wetlands of the Chesapeake and these sectors suffer as the marshes deteriorate. In
order to assess the economic effects this decline represents, this report analyzed scientific
literature, expert opinions and economic indices for commercial and recreational uses of
marshland and marsh-associated species in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay.
If marshes continue to be lost at the current rate, the financial losses to the State of
Maryland and its citizens are summarized in Table E-1 and E-2, below. In Table E-1, it
is clear that the direct losses due to declines in commercially and recreationally-valued
species alone are considerable annually and over the next 50 years. In Table E-2, it is
demonstrated that the losses in environmental services provided by wetlands, and the
associated social losses add another layer to the costs.   Taken together, the figures represented in Tables E-1 and E-2 present a challenge to the
State of Maryland and its citizens. These losses can be mitigated and lessened
considerably if marsh loss is slowed by removal of nutria. Otherwise, the economic
ramifications of damage to Chesapeake Bay marshes in the past and into the future are
costly and will continue to increase unless the necessary actions are taken. The costs of
nutria removal are potentially minor compared to the costs to the State if the loss of
marsh habitats continues unabated.",2004,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Myocastoridae,Myocastor,Myocastor coypus,,nutria,Aquatic,semi-aquatic,N,Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay; emergent wetlands,11,NA,North America,USA,Maryland,Chesapeake Bay,Unit (part of bay),"""over the next 50 years""",Year,2002,2051,2002,2051,Potentially ongoing,8722843,NA,NA,11319895.75,11319895.75,8722843,11319895.75,11319895.75,USD,2004,Publication year,Potential,Extrapolation,Environment/Public and social welfare,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,High,,,,,no,"Potential environmental services loss in Table E2.

SC1458,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This amounts to about $10.63 on each infested grazing land acre and $3.95 on each infested wildland acre. Direct plus secondary economic impacts, estimated using an input-output model, are about $42 million annually, which could support over 500 jobs in the state’s economy.

SC1520,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

The U.S. government introduced an eradication policy in which growers are required to remove infected trees and receive compensation payments for doing so. Recent hurricanes
have spread the disease and re-established it. This chapter examines the economic impacts of citrus
canker in oranges and the eradication policy in Florida, taking into account the relationship between costs
and benefits of eradication and the spatial and dynamic aspects of infestation. We evaluate both the costs
of the disease and the benefits from eradication. In this evaluation we consider the implications of a future
hurricane, which spreads citrus canker, for the decision about whether to adopt a strategy of eradicating
initially, or after the hurricane, or both. We find that producers as a group benefit from both the disease
and the eradication program, but at the expense of taxpayers, consumers and the nation as a whole.
Producers benefit at the expense of consumers because both the disease and the policy to eradicate it
reduce supply and drive up the price and the gross value of production. Producers also benefit at the

It took more than 25 years of research and development to bring Bt from first experimental use in the early 1960s into full operational use in the mid 1980s. Critical to this process was the adoption of HD-1 for commercial use, the standardization of formulations based on international units, and the development of higher potency products. An increase in product potency from 4 BIU/L in the early 1970s to 16.9 BIU/L in the mid 1980s, concomittant with improvements in formulation and application technology, reduced treatment costs while at the same time improving reliability of efficacy. A shift in political climate pushed Bt into operational use by 1985. Since then, Bt has been used in more than half of all spruce budworm control programs. The use of high-potency formulations (12.7 to 16.9 BIU/L) applied undiluted at 30 BIU in 2.4 L/ha or less has significantly reduced but not eliminated initial constraints of high treatment costs and inconsistent efficacy. Current research is focussed on further reducing these constraints. In the short term, registration of formulations containing 25 BIU/L or more is expected to permit application of reduced dosages in less than 1 L/ha and to clear the way for adoption of a split application scheme to increase reliability of efficacy. Selection and commercialization of more effective strains and the enhancement of natural strains by genetic or genetic engineering techniques offer exciting prospects for improvements in the longer term.",1990,English,Peer-reviewed article,Nealis2002,Yes,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Lepidoptera,Tortricidae,Choristoneura,Choristoneura fumiferana,,spruce budworm,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,forest,1\2,NA,North America,Canada,Quebec,Unspecified,Unit (Province),1985,Year,1985,1985,1985,1985,One-time,13994390,NA,NA,22501333.91,21163863.36,13994390,22501333.91,21163863.36,CAD,1990,Publication year,Observed,Report/Estimation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Control,Management_costs,Post-invasion_management,High,,,,,no,"Calculated from Tables 2 and 3: (Area treated with Bt x cost of Bt) + (remaining area treated with chemicals x cost of chemicals).

SC1540,,Washington2008,Invaders at the Gate - 2008 Strategic Plan,Washington Invasive Species Council,"Washington, the Evergreen State, is known for its lush, environmentally diverse landscapes. From the state’s ocean beaches, to its forests, to its grassy prairies, Washington is home to thousands of different plant and animal species. Among the 50 states it ranks in the top 15 for diversity of native species plants, animals, and birds.1Be it an orange-toothed rodent, a long-horned beetle, or a purple-flowered plant, invading  species of all kinds cross state borders or expand their presence into Washington every day. They come as the result of migration, deliberate introduction, and, very often, by chance. When invaders do make it past the front gate, they can bring unintended consequences. They can decimate native species and quickly degrade ecosystems. Animal and plant invaders – those already past the front gate and others trying to get through – have the potential to change the face of Washington, forever.  Invasive species are a threat to Washington’s environment and economy, exacting a high price for their presence. These biological invasions can produce serious, often irreversible effects on agriculture, recreation, and natural resources. While not all non-native species have aggressive traits, the sheer number of these species coming through our gates is increasing at an alarming rate. There are more than 650 non-native plant species documented in Washington.2  This figure represents only a fraction of the total number of non-native species present in the state. Because of the devastating effect on Washington’s plant, animal, and economy by some of these invaders, Washington citizens pay millions of dollars each year to prevent, control, and eradicate invasive species.Washington has several programs that have received national recognition for combating the negative effects of invasive species. However, the state lacks fundamental information such as:  important resources at risk, invasive species distribution, the extent of infestations, and the amount spent by agencies and programs. Furthermore, no comprehensive data have ever been compiled to present a broad picture of the invasive species problem or the degree to which the state’s current programs are managing the problem.

The Great Lakes span a distance of 1200 km and cover a surface area of 244 000 km2 (Fuller et al. 1995). They account for 18% of the planet’s supply of fresh surface water, which is surpassed in volume only by the polar ice caps (only 1% of the Great Lakes’ freshwater supply is renewable). The waters of the Great Lakes flow eastward into the Atlantic Ocean through the
St. Lawrence River. The ecosystems contained within the Great Lakes drainage basin are richly diverse and include 100 taxa and 31 ecological community types
that are considered globally significant by the Nature Conservancy (Rankin and Crispin 1994). The Great Lakes basin has also been important to the history and development of the United States and Canada. Significant industrial and agricultural development has occurred within the basin: 45% of Canada’s industrial capacity
and 25% of Canada’s agricultural capacity. More than 33 million people live within the Great Lakes basin (Fuller et al. 1995), with about 9 million residing in Canada. Great Lakes water resources provide billions of dollars of economic value and thousands of jobs to the region.

SC1552,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

Typically, land managers seek local weed impact estimates (e.g. ranches, parks) and policy-makers want to know how weeds are impacting entire regions. Our goal was to provide local and regional impact estimates for a ubiquitous invasive weed: leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.). The specific impacts we looked at related to desired species biomass production, livestock carrying capacities, and grazing land values. Our basic approach was to use an empirical model that characterizes weed biomass across the landscape in combination with another empirical model that predicts weed impact from weed biomass. Our investigation revealed that, without on-site plant biomass data, site-specific leafy spurge impacts are highly uncertain. Supplementing our general predictive model with small quantities of on-site data increased precision considerably. For the 17-state region we considered, 95% Bayesian credibility intervals indicated leafy spurge reduces cattle carrying capacities by 50–217 thousand animals a year and reduces grazing land values by 8–34 million dollars a year.

SC1565,,Harris2002,"Biological control of weeds in Canada: results, opportunities and constraints (in Claudi. M. et al. (eds.) Alien Invaders in Canada’s Waters, Wetlands, and Forests)","Harris, Shamoun","[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] Biological control refers to the deliberate use of natural enemies (predators, parasites, pathogens, and competitors) to reduce a pest species to an acceptable density. There are three approaches: classical (inoculative), inundative (bioherbicide), and manipulative (conservation). The choice depends on whether the pest is native or alien, present on cultivated or uncultivated land, how persistent the species is, and whether the goal of control is economic or environmental. In this paper the target pests are weeds, but the approaches and principles are also applicable to insects and other organisms. With one exception, the Canadian weed biological control program targets weeds that cause economic losses in agriculture and forestry. This has required that biological control be integrated into crop management and be acceptable to the general public.

Classical biological control agents are self-perpetuating with varying dispersal abilities to provide
continuing control. Typically the targets are introduced plants that form dense persistent populations on uncultivated grasslands. The agents are frequently insects, but diseases and nematodes can be used. Whatever the species that is used, it must not harm desirable plants. Classical biological control is unlikely to be effective against short-term transitional weeds unless the agent disperses extremely well, increases rapidly, and has a high impact. Given the right problem, classical biological control is the cheapest and most environmentally friendly solution. 

Some oppose classical biological control because it involves establishing an alien species which, as such, does not belong in a natural Canadian environment. However, the habitat is no longer native if an alien weed dominates it. Biological control can usually transform a community dominated by an alien weed to a native community with a small weed component and population of its biological control agent. The US Agricultural
Risk Protection Act, 2000, recognizes this benefit. More meaningful concerns reflect the need for biological
control and the host range of the agents. 

Establishing the need for classical biological control involves weighing the costs versus the benefits in economic and ecological terms, which includes the possible impact on non-target organisms. Demonstrating that an agent will be safe costs about two scientist years, or about $800 000. For an in-depth discussion, see Corrigan in this publication (p. 279) and Harris (2000a) The enabling legislation is Canada’s Plant Protection Act. 

The basic criterion of safety used in North America is that the insect does not develop on desirable plants when confined to them. Certainly plants unsuitable in the tests are not at risk. However, during testing, larvae commonly develop on other plants in the host genus even when they do not attack them in nature. Unfortunately most alien weeds are in genera with native species; therefore, the test normally indicates that native plants are vulnerable, although less than 5% of the agents will attack them in nature. The discrepancy between the test and the field results arises because, for most insects, host selection is the responsibility of the egg-laying female. Thus, to identify problems more accurately, biological control agents developing on native plant species in the test need to be further subjected as adults to field tests, acceptable to the regulators, in regions where the native plant species occur. 

Classical biological control is used against alien forest weeds, but in Canada forest losses are largely from native plants. This dictates the use of inundative biological control, which uses native organisms, typically fungi, that are grown on a nutrient medium and then sprayed on the weed in a problem area. This creates a temporary local outbreak that declines in one to five years to the normal level in the environment. Damage to non-target plants must be limited, which means that the controlling organism either has a narrow host range or is restricted by the application method. The primary use of this method has been against native plants that increase following logging or other disturbances to interfere with forest regeneration. Watson and Wall (1995) provide background information. In agriculture, inundative biological control is of interest for major crop weeds that are not controlled by other means. The enabling legislation is Canada’s Pest Control Products Act. Present constraints to this method are the high cost of registration and the often small market for the product. 

Manipulative biological control modifies a habitat to improve the competitive advantage of existing natural…

Yellow starthistle(Centaurea solstitialis L., hereafter YST) is the most widespread noncrop weed in California, resulting in serious damage to forage on natural range and improved pasture. A survey was administered to California cattle ranchers to investigate YST infestation rates, loss of forage quantity and value, and control or eradication efforts. The results were used to estimate countywide losses and costs for 3 focus counties, as well as statewide losses/costs, due to YST in California. Total losses of livestock forage value due to YST on private land for the state of California are estimated at $7.65 million per year, with ranchers’ out-of-pocket expenditures on YST control amounting to $9.45 million per year. Together, these amount to the equivalent of 6%–7% of the total annual harvested pasture value for the state. Therefore, while the impacts are relatively small within the statewide total agricultural production system, losses and costs due to YST infestation do constrain California’s livestock grazing sector.

SC1583,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1598,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts.

SC1605,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1610,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention.

Losses of livestock have been reduced by $3.7 million/year. Additional savings have accrued through increased productivity of pastures ($1.27 million/year) and by reducing herbicide use ($0.85 million/year). Control of ragwort was achieved at a cost of about $5/ha. Non-market benefits include return of desirable flora in habitats once dominated by ragwort and a reduction in herbicide in the environment. Several correlative observations substantiate evidence used in estimating benefits of the regional control of ragwort. In western Oregon, control of ragwort reduced propagule production, which correlated with a decline in the number of new infestations in eastern Oregon, despite increased detection efforts.

We   estimated   hydropower   maintenance   costs   associated   with   zebra   mussels   by   examining  the  Bonneville  Dam  First  Powerhouse,  costs  associated  with  Asian  clam  (Corbicula fluminea) control at Bonneville, and a survey of zebra mussel mitigation costs at other hydropower generation facilities in North America.

The estimated cost for a hypothetical zebra mussel mitigation strategy,  based  upon  two  response  scenarios  (a  sodium  hypochlorite  (NaOCl)  injection  system and anti-fouling paint), at 13 select hydroelectric projects, was $23,621,000.  The cost per generator was $62,599 for the NaOCl system, and $81,000 for antifouling paint (not including labor).  Removal, painting, sandblasting and installation could potentially double antifouling paint treatment costs.  We estimated that if a NaOCl system was installed at an “average” size Columbia River Basin facility, assuming intermittent use, annual operating costs would likely not exceed $100,000.    Operating  costs  will  vary  depending  on  the  facility,  degree  of  infestation,  environmental permits, etc. This  investigation  found  that  once  utilities  initiate  long-term  mussel  control  programs,  they usually become part of routine maintenance at annual, biennial, or longer intervals, depending on how rapidly the mussels recolonize the systems.   A detailed management plan is needed to determine the best zebra mussel mitigation and control strategy for the FCRPS.

SC1628,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1636,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species.

SC1646,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1655,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.",2009,English,Official report,NA,Yes,Chromista,Oomycota,Peronosporea,Peronosporales,Peronosporaceae,Phytophthora,Phytophthora ramorum,,,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,NA,NA,NA,North America,USA,Oregon,Southwest Oregon,Site,3-5 years,Period,2009,2012,2009,2012,One-time,28000000,21000000,35000000,31877699.21,31877699.21,7000000,7969424.8,7969424.8,USD,2008,Effective,Potential,Extrapolation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Eradication,Management_costs,Post-invasion_management,High,,,,,no,"pp10: ""The cost of compete eradication is estimated to be a minimum of $7 million per year for a period of three to five years"".

SC1659,,Washington2008,Invaders at the Gate - 2008 Strategic Plan,Washington Invasive Species Council,"Washington, the Evergreen State, is known for its lush, environmentally diverse landscapes. From the state’s ocean beaches, to its forests, to its grassy prairies, Washington is home to thousands of different plant and animal species. Among the 50 states it ranks in the top 15 for diversity of native species plants, animals, and birds.1Be it an orange-toothed rodent, a long-horned beetle, or a purple-flowered plant, invading  species of all kinds cross state borders or expand their presence into Washington every day. They come as the result of migration, deliberate introduction, and, very often, by chance. When invaders do make it past the front gate, they can bring unintended consequences. They can decimate native species and quickly degrade ecosystems. Animal and plant invaders – those already past the front gate and others trying to get through – have the potential to change the face of Washington, forever.  Invasive species are a threat to Washington’s environment and economy, exacting a high price for their presence. These biological invasions can produce serious, often irreversible effects on agriculture, recreation, and natural resources. While not all non-native species have aggressive traits, the sheer number of these species coming through our gates is increasing at an alarming rate. There are more than 650 non-native plant species documented in Washington.2  This figure represents only a fraction of the total number of non-native species present in the state. Because of the devastating effect on Washington’s plant, animal, and economy by some of these invaders, Washington citizens pay millions of dollars each year to prevent, control, and eradicate invasive species.Washington has several programs that have received national recognition for combating the negative effects of invasive species. However, the state lacks fundamental information such as:  important resources at risk, invasive species distribution, the extent of infestations, and the amount spent by agencies and programs. Furthermore, no comprehensive data have ever been compiled to present a broad picture of the invasive species problem or the degree to which the state’s current programs are managing the problem.

SC1660,TC,MarylandDNR2004,Potential Economic Losses Associated With Uncontrolled Nutria Populations in Maryland's Portion of the Chesapeake Bay,Maryland Department of Natural Resources,"Nutria (Myocaster coypus) are non-native aquatic mammals that are having an
unprecedented negative effect on the marshes and ecology of the Chesapeake Bay. Since
their introduction in the 1930's, nutria populations have continued to expand. With their
high reproductive rate and voracious appetite for marsh grasses and root mats, they are
now damaging hundreds of acres of valuable wetlands each year and turning oncevegetated
areas into mudflats and open-water. These denuded areas no longer provide
rich spawning and nursery grounds and habitat for the many species of shellfish, fish and
wildlife that this region is known for. Although the effects of nutria cannot be easily
separated from other detrimental factors, they are widely believed to be a large
contributing cause of the decline in the quality and extent of Chesapeake Bay wetlands.
As more and more acres of Chesapeake Bay marshes are lost, the resulting declines in
commercially and recreationally-valuable species takes a measurable economic toll on
the State ofMaiyland and its citizens. Commercial harvesting of shellfish and finfish,
sport hunting and fishing, and wildlife viewing in Maryland all have strong connections
to the wetlands of the Chesapeake and these sectors suffer as the marshes deteriorate. In
order to assess the economic effects this decline represents, this report analyzed scientific
literature, expert opinions and economic indices for commercial and recreational uses of
marshland and marsh-associated species in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay.
If marshes continue to be lost at the current rate, the financial losses to the State of
Maryland and its citizens are summarized in Table E-1 and E-2, below. In Table E-1, it
is clear that the direct losses due to declines in commercially and recreationally-valued
species alone are considerable annually and over the next 50 years. In Table E-2, it is
demonstrated that the losses in environmental services provided by wetlands, and the
associated social losses add another layer to the costs.   Taken together, the figures represented in Tables E-1 and E-2 present a challenge to the
State of Maryland and its citizens. These losses can be mitigated and lessened
considerably if marsh loss is slowed by removal of nutria. Otherwise, the economic
ramifications of damage to Chesapeake Bay marshes in the past and into the future are
costly and will continue to increase unless the necessary actions are taken. The costs of
nutria removal are potentially minor compared to the costs to the State if the loss of
marsh habitats continues unabated.",2004,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Myocastoridae,Myocastor,Myocastor coypus,,nutria,Aquatic,semi-aquatic,N,Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay; emergent wetlands,11,NA,North America,USA,Maryland,Chesapeake Bay,Unit (part of bay),"""over the next 50 years""",Year,2002,2051,2002,2051,Potentially ongoing,28136121,NA,NA,36513090.56,36513090.56,28136121,36513090.56,36513090.56,USD,2004,Publication year,Potential,Extrapolation,Public and social welfare,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,High,,,,,no,"Potential social losses in Table E2.

SC1661,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

It is classed as aFederal Noxious Weed in the United States and as a Prohibit-ed Aquatic Plant and Noxious Weed in the state of Florida.

SC1704,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1708,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control.

The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control.

SC1744,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention.

SC1752,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

A.","Research was initiated in 1989 to develop a bioeconomic model of leafy spurge in the upper Great Plains. The study resulted in two M.S. theses, several monographs, and numerous articles in periodicals and professional journals. Methods included budget analyses and regional economic analyses. Models of leafy spurge patch expansion, infestation and grazing carrying capacity, infestation and wildlife habitat, and wildlife and wildlands were developed. Leafy spurge infestation results in an estimated direct annual impact of $40.5 million in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.

SC1761,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1801,,Horsch2008,Quantifying the Economic Effects of Invasive Species?: A Non-Market Valuation Analysis of Eurasian Watermilfoil,"Horsch, E.J.","One consequence of our increasingly globalized world is the ease at which humans and
other species can move or be moved around the planet. As a result, exotic species have been
accidentally or intentionally introduced to non-native areas, many of which have become
invasive. Consequently, vast sums of money are spent each year to control the spread of
invasive species and to address their adverse effects on ecosystems and the economy.
Generally, the costs of invasive species are estimated based on the costs of managing
species invasions, including the amount that must be spent to repair infrastructure damage.
However, this is a conservative estimate of the social costs associated with invasive species as
they also affect biodiversity, ecosystems, and other environmental amenities whose values are
not readily observed in a market. Relatively little economic research has been done concerning
the non-market effects of invasive species.
The purpose of this study is to estimate a hedonic pricing model of lakeshore property
values to quantify the economic costs of a common aquatic invasive species, Eurasian
watermilfoil (EWM), across an extensive lake system in the northern forest region of Wisconsin.
The hedonic pricing model is estimated using a database on property sales and lake-specific
characteristics over the period 1997-2006.
While the primary purpose of the hedonic analysis is to isolate the price effect associated
with the presence and abundance of EWM, two major econometric challenges arise: spatial
autocorrelation and the endogeneity of EWM. Spatial autocorrelation arises due to the fact that
the prices associated with multiple parcels on the same lake are likely to be influenced by similar
unobserved lake-specific characteristics. Endogeneity problems arise because EWM is typically
spread by the movement of recreational boaters, where boaters are more likely to visit lakes with
attractive characteristics. To the extent that the attractiveness of a lake is unobserved to the
analyst, EWM will be correlated with the error term in the hedonic model and OLS estimation
will produce coefficient estimates that are positively biased.
Both issues are accounted for, in part, by defining each lake as a natural neighborhood
and estimating a fixed effect for each lake within the model. The endogeneity of EWM is further
accounted for by exploiting recent EWM invasions as a natural experiment with a difference-indifference
approach to hedonic analysis. Since only a portion of properties in the data set are
affected by EWM, this methodology is useful for identifying the unbiased effect of EWM,
eliminating any differences that may have been present before its introduction. Thus, the
methodology used requires a panel data set to ensure observations are present both before and
after the introduction of EWM.
Results indicate that lakes invaded with EWM experienced an average decrease in land
values by 13% after invasion. The EWM results are robust across linear and non-linear
specifications. This study addresses a topic that is both unique to the current environmental
economics literature and yet widely important for all natural resource management. Despite the
documented prevalence and detrimental effects of EWM, the associated economic and social
costs are yet to be understood. In addition, the econometric challenges seen in this study are
highly relevant to the field in general, particularly with the growing focus on spatial
econometrics. Solutions for the issues of spatial autocorrelation and endogeneity remain elusive.
The spatial difference-in-difference specification presented in this study offers a unique solution
to these challenges, yet is simple enough to be estimated with linear regression techniques.",2008,English,PhD thesis,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Saxifragales,Haloragaceae,Myriophyllum,Myriophyllum spicatum,,Eurasian watermilfoil,Aquatic,aquatic,N,NA,11,N,North America,USA,,Villas County,Site,2006,Period,Unspecified,Unspecified,2006,2006,Potentially ongoing,73840000,,,89783622.17,89783622.17,73840000,89783622.17,89783622.17,USD,2006,Effective,Potential,Extrapolation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,Low,,,,,no,Aggregate cost to house prices from twenty lakes infested and 2637 parcels.,Ross Cuthbert,

SC1818,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

Alien Invaders in Canada’s Waters, Wetlands, and Forests)",Dawson M.,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] Invasive alien species have been reported to cause serious damage to agriculture, forestry, and the environment in many countries, including Canada. International actions to reduce the spread and damage of all invasive species are currently being undertaken under the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity to which Canada is a party. Plant quarantine pests are invasive alien pests that are capable of causing economic damage to agricultural crops or forest trees. These pests, which are classified as either absent or of restricted distribution in Canada, are controlled by the application of specific regulations aimed at preventing their artificial spread by human means (FAO 1999). Included in the classification are insects, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses, and weeds; to date, weeds have not been subjected to quarantine actions.

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada’s Land Base Resources
Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2). Damage resulting from past introductions of harmful invasive plant pests is currently estimated to be $7.3 billion annually (Table 1). Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Agriculture
A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species. Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa Kühn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe). Golden nematode is a major pest of potatoes in cool-temperate regions; it attacks the roots of the potato plants, causing thefoliage to yellow, wilt, and die. The oriental fruit moth…

SC1847,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1862,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species.

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention.

About three-quarters of all domestic livestock depend upon grazing lands for survival. Many ranges have had domestic stock grazing for more than 100 years and, as a result, the plant composition has changed greatly from the original ecosystems. Western rangelands previously dominated by perennial bunchgrasses have been converted, primarily through overgrazing, to annual grasslands that are susceptible to invasion by introduced dicots. Today there are more than 300 rangeland weeds in the United States. Some of the most problematic include Bromus tectorum, Euphorbia esula, Centaurea solstitialis, C. diffusa, C. maculosa, and a number of other Centaurea species. In total, weeds in rangeland cause an estimated loss of $2 billion annually in the United States, which is more than all other pests combined. They impact the livestock industry by lowering yield and quality of forage, interfering with grazing, poisoning animals, increasing costs of managing and producing livestock, and reducing land value. They also impact wildlife habitat and forage, deplete soil and water resources, and reduce plant and animal diversity. Numerous mechanical and cultural control options have been developed to manage noxious rangeland weeds, including mowing, prescribed burning, timely grazing, and perennial grass reseeding or interseeding. In addition, several herbicides are registered for use on rangelands and most biological control programs focus on noxious rangeland weed control. Successful management of noxious weeds on rangeland will require the development of a long-term strategic plan incorporating prevention programs, education materials and activities, and economical and sustainable multi-year integrated approaches that improve degraded rangeland communities, enhance the utility of the ecosystem, and prevent reinvasion or encroachment by other noxious weed species.

SC1879,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species.

SC1899,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1909,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.

Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.

SC1920,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.",2009,English,Official report,NA,Yes,Chromista,Oomycota,Peronosporea,Peronosporales,Peronosporaceae,Phytophthora,Phytophthora ramorum,,,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,NA,NA,NA,North America,USA,Oregon,Southwest Oregon,Site,Year,Year,Unspecified,2009,2009,2009,Potentially ongoing,195500000,81000000,310000000,222574649.8,222574649.8,195500000,222574649.8,222574649.8,USD,2008,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Authorities-Stakeholders/Forestry,Control/Damage-Loss,Mixed_costs,NA,High,,,,,no,"pp10: ""The potential loss to the nursery industry and forests from SOD is estimated to be between $81 million and $310 million per year (for direct control, management, and regulatory compliance costs plus loss of markets).""

SC1921,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.

This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1934,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts.

SC1935,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species.

About three-quarters of all domestic livestock depend upon grazing lands for survival. Many ranges have had domestic stock grazing for more than 100 years and, as a result, the plant composition has changed greatly from the original ecosystems. Western rangelands previously dominated by perennial bunchgrasses have been converted, primarily through overgrazing, to annual grasslands that are susceptible to invasion by introduced dicots. Today there are more than 300 rangeland weeds in the United States. Some of the most problematic include Bromus tectorum, Euphorbia esula, Centaurea solstitialis, C. diffusa, C. maculosa, and a number of other Centaurea species. In total, weeds in rangeland cause an estimated loss of $2 billion annually in the United States, which is more than all other pests combined. They impact the livestock industry by lowering yield and quality of forage, interfering with grazing, poisoning animals, increasing costs of managing and producing livestock, and reducing land value. They also impact wildlife habitat and forage, deplete soil and water resources, and reduce plant and animal diversity. Numerous mechanical and cultural control options have been developed to manage noxious rangeland weeds, including mowing, prescribed burning, timely grazing, and perennial grass reseeding or interseeding. In addition, several herbicides are registered for use on rangelands and most biological control programs focus on noxious rangeland weed control. Successful management of noxious weeds on rangeland will require the development of a long-term strategic plan incorporating prevention programs, education materials and activities, and economical and sustainable multi-year integrated approaches that improve degraded rangeland communities, enhance the utility of the ecosystem, and prevent reinvasion or encroachment by other noxious weed species.

SC1947,TC,MarylandDNR2004,Potential Economic Losses Associated With Uncontrolled Nutria Populations in Maryland's Portion of the Chesapeake Bay,Maryland Department of Natural Resources,"Nutria (Myocaster coypus) are non-native aquatic mammals that are having an
unprecedented negative effect on the marshes and ecology of the Chesapeake Bay. Since
their introduction in the 1930's, nutria populations have continued to expand. With their
high reproductive rate and voracious appetite for marsh grasses and root mats, they are
now damaging hundreds of acres of valuable wetlands each year and turning oncevegetated
areas into mudflats and open-water. These denuded areas no longer provide
rich spawning and nursery grounds and habitat for the many species of shellfish, fish and
wildlife that this region is known for. Although the effects of nutria cannot be easily
separated from other detrimental factors, they are widely believed to be a large
contributing cause of the decline in the quality and extent of Chesapeake Bay wetlands.
As more and more acres of Chesapeake Bay marshes are lost, the resulting declines in
commercially and recreationally-valuable species takes a measurable economic toll on
the State ofMaiyland and its citizens. Commercial harvesting of shellfish and finfish,
sport hunting and fishing, and wildlife viewing in Maryland all have strong connections
to the wetlands of the Chesapeake and these sectors suffer as the marshes deteriorate. In
order to assess the economic effects this decline represents, this report analyzed scientific
literature, expert opinions and economic indices for commercial and recreational uses of
marshland and marsh-associated species in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay.
If marshes continue to be lost at the current rate, the financial losses to the State of
Maryland and its citizens are summarized in Table E-1 and E-2, below. In Table E-1, it
is clear that the direct losses due to declines in commercially and recreationally-valued
species alone are considerable annually and over the next 50 years. In Table E-2, it is
demonstrated that the losses in environmental services provided by wetlands, and the
associated social losses add another layer to the costs.   Taken together, the figures represented in Tables E-1 and E-2 present a challenge to the
State of Maryland and its citizens. These losses can be mitigated and lessened
considerably if marsh loss is slowed by removal of nutria. Otherwise, the economic
ramifications of damage to Chesapeake Bay marshes in the past and into the future are
costly and will continue to increase unless the necessary actions are taken. The costs of
nutria removal are potentially minor compared to the costs to the State if the loss of
marsh habitats continues unabated.",2004,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Myocastoridae,Myocastor,Myocastor coypus,,nutria,Aquatic,semi-aquatic,N,Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay; emergent wetlands,11,NA,North America,USA,Maryland,Chesapeake Bay,Unit (part of bay),"""over the next 50 years""",Year,2002,2051,2002,2051,Potentially ongoing,251079302,,,325833162.8,325833162.8,251079302,325833162.8,325833162.8,USD,2004,Publication year,Potential,Extrapolation,Fishery/Public and social welfare,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,High,,,,,no,"Sum of ""potential annual loss in 50 years"" from Table E1.

SC1948,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one

standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.

SC1956,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.

We simulated management strategies including (1) no control (NC), and control beginning as soon asthe percentage of invaded forest land exceeded (2) 60 (Low Control), (3) 25 (Medium Control), or (4) 0 (High Control) using aspatially-explicit, stochastic, bioeconomic model. With NC, simulated invasions spread northward and westward intoArkansas and along the Gulf of Mexico to occupy<1.2 million hectares within 20 years, with associated expected total costsincreasing exponentially to<$300 million. With LC, MC, and HC, invaded areas reached<275, 34, and 2 thousand hectaresafter 20 years, respectively, with associated expected costs reaching<$400, $230, and $200 million. Complete eradicationwould not be cost-effective; the minimum expected total cost was achieved when control began as soon as the percentageof invaded land exceeded 5%.

Alien Invaders in Canada’s Waters, Wetlands, and Forests)",Dawson M.,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] Invasive alien species have been reported to cause serious damage to agriculture, forestry, and the environment in many countries, including Canada. International actions to reduce the spread and damage of all invasive species are currently being undertaken under the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity to which Canada is a party. Plant quarantine pests are invasive alien pests that are capable of causing economic damage to agricultural crops or forest trees. These pests, which are classified as either absent or of restricted distribution in Canada, are controlled by the application of specific regulations aimed at preventing their artificial spread by human means (FAO 1999). Included in the classification are insects, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses, and weeds; to date, weeds have not been subjected to quarantine actions.

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada’s Land Base Resources
Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2). Damage resulting from past introductions of harmful invasive plant pests is currently estimated to be $7.3 billion annually (Table 1). Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Agriculture
A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species. Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa Kühn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe). Golden nematode is a major pest of potatoes in cool-temperate regions; it attacks the roots of the potato plants, causing thefoliage to yellow, wilt, and die. The oriental fruit moth…

SC1978,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention.

SC1987,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC","Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one

standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC2046,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species.

Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2). Damage resulting from past introductions of harmful invasive plant pests is currently estimated to be $7.3 billion annually (Table 1). Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Agriculture
A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species. Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa Kühn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe). Golden nematode is a major pest of potatoes in cool-temperate regions; it attacks the roots of the potato plants, causing thefoliage to yellow, wilt, and die. The oriental fruit moth…

About three-quarters of all domestic livestock depend upon grazing lands for survival. Many ranges have had domestic stock grazing for more than 100 years and, as a result, the plant composition has changed greatly from the original ecosystems. Western rangelands previously dominated by perennial bunchgrasses have been converted, primarily through overgrazing, to annual grasslands that are susceptible to invasion by introduced dicots. Today there are more than 300 rangeland weeds in the United States. Some of the most problematic include Bromus tectorum, Euphorbia esula, Centaurea solstitialis, C. diffusa, C. maculosa, and a number of other Centaurea species. In total, weeds in rangeland cause an estimated loss of $2 billion annually in the United States, which is more than all other pests combined. They impact the livestock industry by lowering yield and quality of forage, interfering with grazing, poisoning animals, increasing costs of managing and producing livestock, and reducing land value. They also impact wildlife habitat and forage, deplete soil and water resources, and reduce plant and animal diversity. Numerous mechanical and cultural control options have been developed to manage noxious rangeland weeds, including mowing, prescribed burning, timely grazing, and perennial grass reseeding or interseeding. In addition, several herbicides are registered for use on rangelands and most biological control programs focus on noxious rangeland weed control. Successful management of noxious weeds on rangeland will require the development of a long-term strategic plan incorporating prevention programs, education materials and activities, and economical and sustainable multi-year integrated approaches that improve degraded rangeland communities, enhance the utility of the ecosystem, and prevent reinvasion or encroachment by other noxious weed species.

major invaders — Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera (L.) Small), Chinese Privet

Information System (GIS) to model spatially explicit dispersal dynamics of these 
species.  Finally, I evaluated economic losses associated with these invasions.  The

endangering our most precious natural treasures. The intruders are alien
species—non-native plants and animals introduced into this country either
intentionally or by accident. Attention to the problem of alien, or exotic,
species often centers on their costs to agriculture, ranching, forestry, and
industry. The price they exact on the nation’s forests, grasslands, and
waterways, however, is at least as great.
The Problem. Alien species now are one of the leading threats to U.S.
species and ecosystems. Of the approximately 4,000 exotic plant species
and 2,300 non-native animal species in the United States, most cause few
problems. Unfortunately, some alien species are proliferating unfettered,
causing severe environmental or economic damage; just 79 of them have
cost the U.S. economy $97 billion. Infestations of introduced pest species
also are changing the very fabric of our natural ecosystems and pushing
endangered species even further toward the brink of extinction. Indeed,
exotics have contributed to the decline of 42 percent of U.S. threatened and
endangered species.
The Dirty Dozen. This rogues’ gallery represents some of America’s
least wanted intruders. These 12 plants and animals exemplify the range of
problems caused by exotic species. Some, such as tamarisk and Chinese
tallow, degrade ecosystems by altering their physical or chemical properties.
Others, including the rosy wolfsnail and brown tree snake, deplete native
wildlife by preying on them. Yet others, such as the zebra mussel or balsam
wooly adelgid, set off cascading biological changes in the natural systems
they invade.
What Can Be Done? Containing the onslaught of exotic species will
not be easy or quick, but it is not impossible. This effort requires work on
four fronts:
Prevention of additional introductions;
Early detection and eradication of new pests;
Control and management of established problem species; and
Protection and recovery of native species and ecosystems.
Our nation’s native plant and animal species, and the ecosystems on
which they—and we—depend, are too important to sacrifice to alien invaders.
This is an issue of both ecological and economic survival. Containing these
invasions requires shared commitment and action. And although the problem
may be expensive to address now, the cost will be far higher if we delay—
both in dollars and diversity. With prompt attention and action, though, we
still have time to safeguard our nation’s unique natural heritage.",1996,English,Report,"Lindgren C.J.

Plant quarantine pests are invasive alien pests that are capable of causing economic damage to agricultural crops or forest trees.

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention.

SC2100,,Cusack2009,The Economics of Invasive Species,"Cusack, Chris, Michael Harte, and Samuel Chan","The prevention, eradication, and control of invasive species is an economic and policy issue and has less to do with biology and ecology than many people involved in managing natural resources realize. Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.",2009,English,Official report,NA,Yes,Plantae,Diverse/Unspecified,Diverse/Unspecified,Diverse/Unspecified,Diverse/Unspecified,Diverse/Unspecified,Diverse/Unspecified,,Diverse/Unspecified,Diverse/Unspecified,diverse/Unspecified,N,NA,NA,NA,North America,USA,,NA,Country,Unspecified,Year,Unspecified,Unspecified,2009,2009,Potentially ongoing,30600000000,,,34837771275,34837771275,30600000000,34837771275,34837771275,USD,2008,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Agriculture/Authorities-Stakeholders,Control/Damage-Loss,Mixed_costs,NA,High,,,,,No,"Table 2: Weeds (U.S.) Control costs, production losses",Nigel Taylor,

Labor is the most expensive portion of a weed management project. It is incumbent upon land managers to use methods that minimize labor costs, and this is especially so with public land managers because they are dependent upon tax dollars to execute their programs. Using herbicides and biological control agents to decrease the population abundance of a target invasive weed are approaches that utilize the least labor to affect initial and continued reduction of the target species. Because biocontrol is developed using public funds, it seems inexpensive to the end user, which includes federal agencies. Biocontrol is a very attractive and highly useful approach to control invasive weed species, however, success has been inconsistent in space and time. There are numerous successful biocontrol endeavors and the literature offers many examples. The USDA Forest Service’s Fire Effects Information System website (www. fs.fed.us/database/feis/) is one of the best and most complete information sources for the biology and management of many invasive weed species. Another outstanding source of information on managing invasive weeds which recently became available is Weed Control in Natural Areas in the Western United States (Joseph DiTomaso et al., 2013: University of California Weed Research and Information Center). It too describes where and upon what species biocontrol has been successful and extensively outlines all management options. If biocontrol is the method selected, land managers must carefully research choices for their effectiveness. The spatial and temporal variation associated with biocontrol performance may be due to many genetic and environmental reasons—from habitat preference by the biocontrol agent to the production of new genotypes from previously geographically separated genotypes now growing in proximity to one another, and many as yet to be discovered reasons. Fire too can be a good tool to decrease populations (DiTomaso et al. 2006) of some invasive weeds, most notably annual grasses and forbs such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). As with other integrated management systems for weeds, the use of fire to manage invasive weeds must be integrated with other tools, such as seeding, to provide competition to ward off recovering weed species and allow for completion of land management goals and objectives. Burning mixed brush-cheatgrass stands destroys some to many weed seeds and allows about one season of desirable vegetation to establish before cheatgrass re-establishes and dominates the site again (Evans and Young 1978; Young and Evans 1978; Young 2000). Establishing competitive perennial grass species may successfully keep cheatgrass from re-establishing. If, however, the system is left alone after burning, cheatgrass or medusahead will re-invade. Burning stands of yellow starthistle also can provide excellent population control if combined with herbicide treatment and seeding (DiTomaso et al. 2006b). Burning stands of a perennial weed, such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) and other knapweeds, or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), is rarely effective because of the plants’ ability to re-grow from its root system and dominate a site again. These and other similar invasive weeds may recover soon enough after a prescribed burn to preclude establishment of seeded species. If fire is used to control perennial forbs or grasses, herbicides will likely have to be integrated into the management system to allow sufficient suppression of the target weed for a long enough time to",2009,English,Slideshow presentation,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Asteraceae,Centaurea,Centaurea affinis/Centaurea stoebe,,spotted knapweed,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,NA,4,N,North America,USA,Diverse/Unspecified,Unspecified,Unit (10 square feet),Unspecified,Year,Unspecified,Unspecified,2009,2009,Potentially ongoing,1.6,0.2,3,1.83,1.83,1.6,1.83,1.83,USD,2009,Publication year,Potential,Extrapolation,Authorities-Stakeholders,Control,Management_costs,Post-invasion_management,Low,,,,,no,"Table 1.

Yellow starthistle(Centaurea solstitialis L., hereafter YST) is the most widespread noncrop weed in California, resulting in serious damage to forage on natural range and improved pasture. A survey was administered to California cattle ranchers to investigate YST infestation rates, loss of forage quantity and value, and control or eradication efforts. The results were used to estimate countywide losses and costs for 3 focus counties, as well as statewide losses/costs, due to YST in California. Total losses of livestock forage value due to YST on private land for the state of California are estimated at $7.65 million per year, with ranchers’ out-of-pocket expenditures on YST control amounting to $9.45 million per year. Together, these amount to the equivalent of 6%–7% of the total annual harvested pasture value for the state. Therefore, while the impacts are relatively small within the statewide total agricultural production system, losses and costs due to YST infestation do constrain California’s livestock grazing sector.

Ecological models of invasive plant spread and control provide a practical tool with which to evaluate alternative management strategies at landscape scales. We developed a spatially explicit model for the spread and control of spotted knapweed and leafy spurge across three Montana landscapes. The objective of the model was to determine the ecological and economic costs and benefits of alternative strategies across landscapes of varying size and stages of infestation. Our results indicate that (1) in the absence of management the area infested will continue to increase exponentially leading to a substantial cost in foregone grazing revenues; (2) even though the costs of management actions are substantial, there is a net economic benefit associated with a broad range of management strategies; (3) strategies a that prioritize targeting small new infestations consistently outperform strategies that target large established patches; and (4) inconsistent treatment and short-term delays can greatly reduce the economic and ecological benefits of management.

SC2166,,Barbier2006,Commercialization decisions and the economics of introduction biological invasions,Barbier  E  Knowler  D,"A commercial horticultural industry that establishes plant-breeding nurseries for an exotic species throughout a regional economy will expand until the marginal profit of the last nursery established is zero. However, a regional government concerned with social welfare will take into account not only the profits of the horticultural industry but also any expected costs of an accidental invasion. The latter costs will consist of the discounted expected social damages due to an increase in the rate of invasion over time and the increase in expected damage cost per hectare caused by an additional nursery.Agovernment can employ an “introducers’ pay” tax equal to the latter social costs to ensure that the plant breeding industry establishes the optimal number of nurseries.We illustrate this outcome with the example of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) in North America. In the absence of any tax, the horticultural industry will establish n = 3528 nursery operations, and the expected damages from invasion are US$ 28.2 million per year. With the tax, only n = 300 nurseries are established but the expected damages from invasion are reduced to US$ 1.3 million per year. Although profits for the horticultural industry are lower from the tax, the net gains in overall social welfare more than offset the losses. Although these results are illustrative only, they show that the problem of plant invasives initiated by commercial operations is amenable to standard economic analysis and solutions, such as implementation of an “introducers’ pay tax”.",2006,English,Peer-reviewed article,ATTRA1997,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Myrtales,Lythraceae,Lythrum,Lythrum salicaria,,Purple loosestrife,Terrestrial,semi-aquatic,N,NA,NA,N,North America,USA,,North America And Canada,Continental,Annual estimation,Year,Unspecified,Unspecified,2006,2006,Potentially ongoing,14744.5,1342,28147,22171.66,22171.66,14744.5,22171.66,22171.66,USD,1998,Effective,Potential,Extrapolation,Agriculture/Authorities-Stakeholders/Environment/Fishery/Forestry/Health/Public and social welfare,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,High,,,,,yes,"These costs are based on a model that predicts anual costs, but they are not allocated to any particular year",Ana Novoa,
SC2169,,Knowler2005,Importing exotic plants and the risk of invasion: are market-based instruments adequate?,"Knowler, D; Barbier, E","Exotic plant species are often intentionally imported into regions outside of their normal range as ornamental plants or as breeding stock, thereby generating benefits for consumers and producers. However, one of the unintended side effects of such introductions is that the exotic plant species may become invasive. Prohibiting sale of this type of exotic plant species, on the basis that it may become invasive, will have social costs in the form of foregone consumer benefits and nursery profits. We develop a model of a private commercial plant breeding industry that imports an exotic plant species into a region. The risk associated with invasion is modeled using a probabilistic ‘hazard function’, the key determinants of which are the characteristics of the exotic plant and the number of commercial nurseries contributing to its dispersal. We consider the possibility of employing market-based instruments (e.g., Pigovian tax) consistent with the concept of ‘introducers pay’, to regulate the nursery industry. We then provide an empirical illustration using the historical introduction of saltcedar (Tamarisk spp.) into the United States. Our results indicate that the mere presence of a risk of invasion does not mean that it is socially optimal to prevent commercial sales of an exotic plant species. Indeed, there appear to be plausible forms of the functional relationships involved that require only a modest reduction in the private industry optimum. In contrast, no sales of the exotic plant should occur at all under several sets of assumptions about the level of invasion risk and the linkage between dispersal sites and invasion hazard.",2005,English,Peer-reviewed article,Zavaleta2003,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Tamaricaceae,Tamarix,Tamarix sp.,,Salt cedar,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,NA,NA,N,North America,USA,,,Country,Approximatelly 2005,Period,2005,2005,2005,2005,One-time,212050000,131600000,292500000,266153740.9,266153740.9,212050000,266153740.9,266153740.9,USD,2005,Publication year,Potential,Report/Estimation,Agriculture/Authorities-Stakeholders/Public and social welfare,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,High,,,,,no,,Ana Novoa,

A prime example of this phenomenon is the cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) invasion of the native shrub-steppe lands in Great Basin of the western United States. The purpose of this study is to develop a bioeconomic model that optimizes simulated ranch behavior given the beginning stages of cheatgrass invasion on a public forage allotment. The bioeconomic model is applied to a typical eastern Oregon 300 cow-calf ranch. Livestock production decisions are simulated over a 40-yr planning horizon using a multiperiod linear programming model. Results showed changes in profit-maximizing ranch management strategies in the form of decreased optimal stocking rates and forage substitution. The net present value of the simulated ranch’s income stream declined, and the probability that the ranch cannot meet its full costs of livestock production and would exit the industry increased as a result. These economic impacts were more pronounced with decreased sale price. Sensitivity analysis showed that overall results in terms of ranch behavior were specific neither to the assumed discount rate nor to the assumed percentage of cheatgrass cover (as long as this percentage is within the reference state) on the public grazing allotment. This study introduces a method for managers to quantify impacts on ranches from fuel-altering invasive plants on public lands, emphasizing the importance of including information about native and invasive forage production characteristics and wildfire frequency as a function of the state of invasion.",2013,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Cyperales,Poaceae,Bromus,Bromus tectorum,,Cheatgrass,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,native shrub-steppe lands in the Great Basin of the western United States,4,N,North America,USA,,Typical Eastern Oregon Cow-calf Operation With A Grazing Allotment In The Great Basin Region.

This study evaluates the economic impacts of tamarisk (Tamarix sp.), an invasive woody shrub, on societally-valued ecosystem services in its naturalized range. Tamarisk, intentionally introduced from Eurasia, has invaded most riparian areas of the arid and semiarid western United States. In its naturalized range, tamarisk consumes more water than native vegetation, with significant economic implications in a region marked by water scarcity. Tamarisk also increases sedimentation in river channels, leading to increased frequency and severity of flood damage. Conservative economic estimates of these impacts indicate that the annual costs of tamarisk to the western United States total USD 280–450 ha–1. Eradicating the invader and restoring native riparian communities throughout the region would cost approximately USD 7400 ha–1. Full recovery of these costs, even with a highly conservative benefits estimate, would occur in as few as 17 years, after which the societal, ecological, and economic benefits of restoration would continue to accrue indefinitely.",2000,English,Peer-reviewed article,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Tamaricaceae,Tamarix,Tamarix sp.,,,Terrestrial,terrestrial,N,Riparian floodplain,9,N,North America,USA,,Semiarid Western United States,Country,1998-2018,Year,1998,2018,1998,2018,Potentially ongoing,209000000,127000000,291000000,314278367.7,314278367.7,209000000,314278367.7,314278367.7,USD,1998,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Agriculture/Public and social welfare,Indirect costs,Damage_costs,NA,High,,,,,no,"Estimates the annual cost with loss of ecosystem services (e.g., irrigation water, municipal water, hydropower, flood control)",Gustavo Heringer,

Nelson), are needed to identify most cost-effective methods. Two adjacent vegetation management experiments were initiated in 2006 and monitored until 2010 in eastern Nevada to compare the costs and efﬁcacy of various tree reduction methods. One Department of Energy (DOE) experiment compared a control to ﬁve treatments: bulldozing imitating chaining ($205 ha 1), lop-pile-burn ($2309 ha 1), lop-and-scatter ($1297 ha 1), feller-buncher and chipper ($4940 ha 1), and mastication ($1136 ha 1), whereas a second Bureau of Land Management (BLM) experiment compared one-way chaining ($205 ha 1) to a control treatment. Chaining and bulldozing resulted in the least reduction of tree cover among the treatments. In the DOE experiment, forb cover only decreased in the mastication treatment. Litter increased in all methods. Slash cover was lowest in the control and lop-pile-burn treatments, intermediate in the feller-buncher and mastication treatments, and highest in the bulldozing and lop-and-scatter treatments. By 2010, forb cover and the combined cover of dead shrubs and trees were increased and decreased, respectively, by chaining in the BLM experiment. Nonnative annual grass and biotic crust were absent or uncommon before and after treatment implementation. In both experiments, tree removal resulted in a nonsigniﬁcant increase in perennial grass cover even 4 yr post-treatment. An ecological return-on-investment (EROI) metric was developed to compare perennial grass cover and tree cover per unit area cost of each active treatment. By 2010, chaining or bulldozing, followed by mastication, showed the highest EROI for improving perennial grass and decreasing tree cover. Mastication is recommended for restoration of smaller tree-encroached areas, whereas land managers should reconsider smooth chaining, despite its negative perceptions, for rapid and cost-efﬁcient restoration of large landscapes obligates.

We   estimated   hydropower   maintenance   costs   associated   with   zebra   mussels   by   examining  the  Bonneville  Dam  First  Powerhouse,  costs  associated  with  Asian  clam  (Corbicula fluminea) control at Bonneville, and a survey of zebra mussel mitigation costs at other hydropower generation facilities in North America. We   found   that   the   one-time   cost   for   installing   zebra   mussel   control   systems   at   hydroelectric  projects  could  range  from  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  to  over  a  million dollars per facility.  The estimated cost for a hypothetical zebra mussel mitigation strategy,  based  upon  two  response  scenarios  (a  sodium  hypochlorite  (NaOCl)  injection  system and anti-fouling paint), at 13 select hydroelectric projects, was $23,621,000.  The cost per generator was $62,599 for the NaOCl system, and $81,000 for antifouling paint (not including labor).

en la Almeja Mano de León (Nodipecten subnodosus), considerando como variables de
respuesta el crecimiento en tallas de la concha, y el peso de la masa muscular. Asimismo,
se evaluó el grado de infestación de la esponja perforadora de sustratos calcáreos Cliona
celata sobre la almeja. Esta investigación se desarrolló en la laguna Ojo de Liebre, Baja
California Sur, México. Se recolectaron 30 organismos de enero 2013 a octubre 2015, en
cuatro bancos almejeros (El Zacatoso, El Chocolatero, El Dátil y La Concha). Los
intervalos de clases de tallas en las conchas fueron cinco, alcanzando el Dátil las mayores
tallas (19cm), mientras que las menores se presentaron en el banco el Chocolatero (4.5cm).
En términos de biomasa, el promedio del peso blando fue de 295.59±3.45gr. Para estimar
la tasa de infestación, se contabilizó el número de ‘ampollas de lodo’ (0-9) y se calculó su
porcentaje en ambas valvas por cada individuo, siendo el Chocolatero el más afectado con
el 40%. Una prueba de t-test demostró diferencias altamente significativas en la abundancia
de ampollas entre valvas (ts = 1.330, P < 0.001), siendo la valva derecha o plana, la
mayormente infectada, debido a que esta última es la valva más expuesta y por lo tanto la
más accesible a la larva del espiónido. En cuanto al grado de infestación producido por
Cliona celata, éste se evaluó mediante la presencia o ausencia de la esponja, siendo el

XX85_MX20,TC,MX20,Especies invasoras de alto impacto a la biodiversidad Prioridades para México,March Mifsut & Martínez (Editores),"Después de la destrucción del hábitat, el impacto por las especies invasoras ha sido identificado como la segunda causa, a nivel global, de la pérdida de biodiversidad (Vitousek, 1996; Leung et al., 2002). Es por ello que este tema se ha convertido en prioritario en el contexto de la Convención de Diversidad Biológica (CDB) de la que México es signatario.
Se define como especie “invasora” a aquella especie exótica o trasladada (cualquier especie, subespecie o categoría infraespecífica), introducida accidental o intencionalmente fuera de su distribución natural actual o en el pasado —incluyendo sus gametos, semillas, huevos o propágulos— con capacidad de colonizar, invadir y persistir, y cuya introducción y dispersión amenace a la diversidad biológica causando daños al ambiente, a la economía y a la salud humana (Convención para la Diversidad Biológica, CDB; el Programa Global sobre Especies Invasoras, GISP, y la Non-indigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, 1990, EUA).
Las especies invasoras desplazan a las especies nativas de flora y fauna por competencia directa, depredación, transmisión de enfermedades, modificación del hábitat, alteración de la estructura de los niveles tróficos y sus condiciones biofísicas, y por la alteración en los regímenes de fuego. Las plantas invasoras acuáticas pueden causar la desecación de los cuerpos de agua, afectando drásticamente la ecología de los paisajes y de los ambientes locales. En ocasiones, las especies invasoras se hibridan con especies nativas alterándose así el pool génico original de las poblaciones nativas (Mooney y Cleland, 2001). Es por esta razón que la conservación de la biodiversidad en un país debe contemplar a la prevención, detección temprana, manejo, control, erradicación, concienciación pública, regulación y legislación, y la investigación sobre especies invasoras como una alta prioridad.
Las especies invasoras, además, tienen un elevado potencial para afectar negativamente una serie de acciones de restauración ecológica, conservación y aprovechamiento sustentable de los recursos naturales (Chornesky et al., 2000). A manera de círculos viciosos, probablemente relacionados con sequías inusuales, muchas especies invasoras adaptadas al fuego contribuyen a promover regímenes anómalos de fuego e incendios catastróficos que, a su vez, afectan a la biodiversidad (Hiremath y Sundaram, 2005).
Por ejemplo, Estados Unidos invierte anualmente enormes cantidades de recursos para mitigar los impactos causados por las especies invasoras en todo su territorio, incluyendo costas y mares (Pimentel et al., 1999; Carlton, 2001; Novell y Stone, 2005). Además, en ese país ha quedado clara la necesidad de que todas las agencias y dependencias de gobierno, así como universidades y organizaciones civiles tengan una estrecha coordinación en sus acciones para efectuar con eficacia el control y manejo de las especies invasoras (U.S. GAO, 2005).
Sin embargo, en México las acciones contra especies invasoras se han enfocado básicamente a aquellas que causan daños económicos a las actividades agrícolas y pecuarias, y han quedado prácticamente ignoradas las que afectan o pueden afectar a la biodiversidad terrestre, marina o dulceacuícola del país.",2007,Spanish,Report,NA,Yes,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Siluriformes,Loricariidae,Pterygoplichthys,Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps,,sailfin plecs,Aquatic,aquatic,N,NA,11,N,North America,Mexico,Michoacán,Presa El Infiernillo,Site,Unspecified,Period,Unspecified,Unspecified,2007,2007,One-time,1500000,,,1773295.503,,,,,USD,2007,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Fishery,Damage-Loss,Damage_costs,NA,Low,,,,,no,,AERS/ELL/LBM,Yes
