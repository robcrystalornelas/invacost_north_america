The alga showed no signs of deterioration 2.5 months after its initial detection. The healthy condition, presence of receptacles with developing oogonia, potential for asexual reproduction, and ability to withstand environmental conditions, both inside the Bay and on the outer Pacific coast, prompted a multiagency eradication effort. Given the relatively small area of shoreline inhabited by the alga, in combination with its absence in 125 other surveyed locations, we decided that manual removal of the seaweed would be the most environmentally sensitive yet effective eradication approach.

endangering our most precious natural treasures. The intruders are alien
species—non-native plants and animals introduced into this country either
intentionally or by accident. Attention to the problem of alien, or exotic,
species often centers on their costs to agriculture, ranching, forestry, and
industry. The price they exact on the nation’s forests, grasslands, and
waterways, however, is at least as great.
The Problem. Alien species now are one of the leading threats to U.S.
species and ecosystems. Of the approximately 4,000 exotic plant species
and 2,300 non-native animal species in the United States, most cause few
problems. Unfortunately, some alien species are proliferating unfettered,
causing severe environmental or economic damage; just 79 of them have
cost the U.S. economy $97 billion. Infestations of introduced pest species
also are changing the very fabric of our natural ecosystems and pushing
endangered species even further toward the brink of extinction. Indeed,
exotics have contributed to the decline of 42 percent of U.S. threatened and
endangered species.
The Dirty Dozen. This rogues’ gallery represents some of America’s
least wanted intruders. These 12 plants and animals exemplify the range of
problems caused by exotic species. Some, such as tamarisk and Chinese
tallow, degrade ecosystems by altering their physical or chemical properties.
Others, including the rosy wolfsnail and brown tree snake, deplete native
wildlife by preying on them. Yet others, such as the zebra mussel or balsam
wooly adelgid, set off cascading biological changes in the natural systems
they invade.
What Can Be Done? Containing the onslaught of exotic species will
not be easy or quick, but it is not impossible. This effort requires work on
four fronts:
Prevention of additional introductions;
Early detection and eradication of new pests;
Control and management of established problem species; and
Protection and recovery of native species and ecosystems.
Our nation’s native plant and animal species, and the ecosystems on
which they—and we—depend, are too important to sacrifice to alien invaders.
This is an issue of both ecological and economic survival. Containing these
invasions requires shared commitment and action. And although the problem
may be expensive to address now, the cost will be far higher if we delay—
both in dollars and diversity. With prompt attention and action, though, we
still have time to safeguard our nation’s unique natural heritage.",EN,,,1996,2002,Unspecified,Damage_costs,Country

already severely damaged Syzygium jambos (Indian rose apple) trees and the federally
endangered Eugenia koolauensis (nioi). Fortunately, the particular strain has yet to cause
serious damage to Metrosideros polymorpha (‘o-hi‘a), which comprises roughly 80% of the
state’s native forests and covers 400,000 ha. Although the rust has affected less than 5% of
Hawaii’s ‘o-hi‘a trees thus far, the introduction of more virulent strains and the genetic
evolution of the current strain are still possible. Since the primary pathway of introduction is
Myrtaceae plant material imported from outside the state, potential damage to ‘o-hi‘a can be
minimized by regulating those high-risk imports. We discuss the economic impact on the
state’s florist, nursery, landscaping, and forest plantation industries of a proposed rule that
would ban the import of non-seed Myrtaceae plant material and require a 1-year quarantine
of seeds. Our analysis suggests that the benefits to the forest plantation industry of a
complete ban on non-seed material would likely outweigh the costs to other affected
sectors, even without considering the reduction in risk to ‘o-hi‘a. Incorporating the value
of ‘o-hi‘a protection would further increase the benefit–cost ratio in favor of an import ban.",EN,,,2012,2012,Public and social welfare,Mixed_costs,Site

Infestations are often overlooked due to the frog’squiet calls, small size, and cryptic behavior, and this likely contributes to itsspread. Because the greenhouse frog is an insectivore, introductions may reduceinvertebrates.

At this density, itis estimated that they can consume up to 129,000 invertebrates ha?1 night?1.They are a food source for the nonnative brown tree snake in Guam and may bea food source for other nonnative species. They may also compete with otherinsectivores for available prey. The greatest direct economic impacts of the invasionsare to the nursery trade, which must treat infested shipments.

colonizer of Hawaii’s forested watersheds. Elimination of satellite populations is critical to an effective containment
strategy, but extreme topography limits accessibility to remote populations by helicopter operations only. Herbicide
Ballistic Technology (HBT) is a novel weed control tool designed to pneumatically deliver encapsulated herbicide
projectiles. It is capable of accurately treating miconia satellites within a 30 m range in either horizontal or vertical
trajectories. Efficacy was examined for the encapsulated herbicide projectiles, each containing 199.4 mg ae triclopyr,
when applied to miconia in 5-unit increments. Experimental calibrations of the HBT platform were recorded on a
Hughes 500-D helicopter while conducting surveillance operations from November 2010 through October 2011 on
the islands of Maui and Kauai. Search efficiency (min ha21; n 5 13, R2 5 0.933, P, 0.001) and target acquisition
rate (plants hr21, n 5 13, R2 5 0.926, P, 0.001) displayed positive linear and logarithmic relationships,
respectively, to plant target density. The search efficiency equation estimated target acquisition time at 25.1 sec and a
minimum surveillance rate of 67.8 s ha21 when no targets were detected. The maximum target acquisition rate for
the HBT platform was estimated at 143 targets hr21. An average mortality factor of 0.542 was derived from the
product of detection efficacy (0.560) and operational treatment efficacy (0.972) in overlapping buffer areas
generated from repeated flight segments (n 5 5). This population reduction value was used in simulation models to
estimate the expected costs for one- and multi-year satellite population control strategies for qualifying options in

colonizer of Hawaii’s forested watersheds. Elimination of satellite populations is critical to an effective containment
strategy, but extreme topography limits accessibility to remote populations by helicopter operations only. Herbicide
Ballistic Technology (HBT) is a novel weed control tool designed to pneumatically deliver encapsulated herbicide
projectiles. It is capable of accurately treating miconia satellites within a 30 m range in either horizontal or vertical
trajectories. Efficacy was examined for the encapsulated herbicide projectiles, each containing 199.4 mg ae triclopyr,
when applied to miconia in 5-unit increments. Experimental calibrations of the HBT platform were recorded on a
Hughes 500-D helicopter while conducting surveillance operations from November 2010 through October 2011 on
the islands of Maui and Kauai. Search efficiency (min ha21; n 5 13, R2 5 0.933, P, 0.001) and target acquisition
rate (plants hr21, n 5 13, R2 5 0.926, P, 0.001) displayed positive linear and logarithmic relationships,
respectively, to plant target density. The search efficiency equation estimated target acquisition time at 25.1 sec and a
minimum surveillance rate of 67.8 s ha21 when no targets were detected. The maximum target acquisition rate for
the HBT platform was estimated at 143 targets hr21. An average mortality factor of 0.542 was derived from the
product of detection efficacy (0.560) and operational treatment efficacy (0.972) in overlapping buffer areas
generated from repeated flight segments (n 5 5). This population reduction value was used in simulation models to
estimate the expected costs for one- and multi-year satellite population control strategies for qualifying options in
cost optimization and risk aversion. This is a first report on the performance of an HBT helicopter platform

However, a regional government concerned with social welfare will take into account not only the profits of the horticultural industry but also any expected costs of an accidental invasion. The latter costs will consist of the discounted expected social damages due to an increase in the rate of invasion over time and the increase in expected damage cost per hectare caused by an additional nursery.Agovernment can employ an “introducers’ pay” tax equal to the latter social costs to ensure that the plant breeding industry establishes the optimal number of nurseries.We illustrate this outcome with the example of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) in North America. In the absence of any tax, the horticultural industry will establish n = 3528 nursery operations, and the expected damages from invasion are US$ 28.2 million per year. With the tax, only n = 300 nurseries are established but the expected damages from invasion are reduced to US$ 1.3 million per year. Although profits for the horticultural industry are lower from the tax, the net gains in overall social welfare more than offset the losses. Although these results are illustrative only, they show that the problem of plant invasives initiated by commercial operations is amenable to standard economic analysis and solutions, such as implementation of an “introducers’ pay tax”.",EN,,,2006,2006,Mixed,Damage_costs,Continental

The area of study was restricted to both sides of the channel and excluded tributaries along the 370 km between Sumner and Brantley dams. Direct costs (helicopter spraying, dead tree removal, and revegetation) within the study area were estimated to be $2.2 million but possibly rising to $6.4 million with the adoption of an aggressive revegetation program. Indirect costs associated with increased potential for erosion and reservoir sedimentation would raise the costs due to increased evaporation from more extensive shallows in the Pecos River as it enters Brantley Reservoir. Actions such as dredging are unlikely given the conservative amount of sediment calculated (about 1% of the reservoir pool). The potential for water salvage was identiﬁed as the only tangible beneﬁt likely to be realized under the current control strategy. Estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) using Landsat TM data allowed estimation of potential water salvage as the difference in ET before and after treatment, an amount totaling 7.41 million m3 (6010 acre-ft) per year. Previous saltcedar control efforts of roughly the same magnitude found that salvaged ET recharged groundwater and no additional ﬂows were realized within the river. Thus, the value of this recharge is probably less than the lowest value quoted for actual in-channel ﬂow, and estimated to be\$63,000 per year. Though couched in terms of costs and beneﬁts, this paper is focused on what can be considered the key trade-off under a complete eradication strategy: water salvage vs. erosion and sedimentation. It differs from previous efforts by focusing on evaluating the impacts of actual control efforts within a speciﬁc system. Total costs (direct plus potential indirect) far outweighed beneﬁts in this simple comparison and are expected to be ongoing. Problems induced by saltcedar control may permanently reduce reservoir capacity and increase reservoir evaporation rates, which could further deplete supplies on this water short system. These potential negative consequences highlight that such costs and beneﬁts need to be considered before initiating extensive saltcedar control programs on river systems of the western United States.",EN,,,2002,2004,Environment,Mixed_costs,Unit

Outcomes are influenced by environmental conditions that vary across space and time, yet such variation is rarely considered in restoration planning. Here, we present a cost-effectiveness analysis of terrestrial restoration methods to determine how practitioners may restore the highest native plant cover per dollar spent. We recorded costs of 120 distinct methods and described success in terms of native versus non-native plant germination, growth, cover, and density. We assessed effectiveness using a basic, commonly used metric (% native plant cover) and developed an index of cost-effectiveness (% native cover per dollar spent on restoration). We then evaluated success of multiple methods, given environmental variation across topography and multiple years, and found that the most successful method for restoring high native plant cover is often different from the method that results in the largest arearestoredperdollarexpended,givenfixedmitigationbudgets.Basedonourresults,wedevelopeddecision-makingtreesto guidepractitionersthroughestablishedphasesofrestoration—sitepreparation,seedingandplanting,andmaintenance.Wealso highlightwhereadditionalresearchcouldinformrestorationpractice,suchasimprovedseasonalweatherforecastsoptimizing allocation of funds in time or valuation practices that include costs of specific outcomes in the collection of in lieu fees.

The results were used to estimate countywide losses and costs for 3 focus counties, as well as statewide losses/costs, due to YST in California. Total losses of livestock forage value due to YST on private land for the state of California are estimated at $7.65 million per year, with ranchers’ out-of-pocket expenditures on YST control amounting to $9.45 million per year.

These nonnative plants and animals have an adverse impact on Washington’s landscapes, ecosystems, agriculture, commerce and recreation. This report aims to help state agencies tasked with managing natural resources to quantify the potential economic damages of a select list of twenty-three invasive species on the overall Washington economy, coupled with a broader understanding as to how these damages translate into lost jobs, lost wages, and lost business sales (or output). Total Costs of Invasive Species Crops: Cropland has the potential to be quickly infested by invasive plants, which reduce overall yields and require resources for their control. Furthermore, crops are directly lost through invasive animal consumption. The direct impact of invasive species on crops grown in Washington is estimated to be $239.5 million per year. Livestock: Invasive noxious weeds in pastures and rangeland displace desirable forage that help sustain livestock. In some cases, these plants are also toxic to livestock and horses and can be fatal. The direct economic impact of invasive species on the livestock industry is estimated to be $120.1 million annually. Timber: Many invasive species can severely impact Washington’s $1.68 billion timber and logging industry. Invasive noxious weed species such as Scotch broom can outcompete new saplings, which reduces future timber harvests. Insect species such as the gypsy moth have a more immediate impact on the timber industry by defoliating and stressing, resulting in mortality of adult trees. The direct economic impact of invasive species on the timber industry is estimated to be $124.8 million. Recreation: Recreational activities such as hunting, fishing, and boating can all be adversely affected by invasive species. Many of the same species that impact a rancher’s ability to range their cattle also reduce elk and deer populations. Aquatic invasive species can cause declines in fish populations and reduce access to popular fishing areas. Other aquatic species can clog up boat propellers and render public boat launches unusable. The direct economic impact to recreational activities from invasive species is estimated to be $20.5 million per year. Most Costly Invasive Species Plant Species Rush skeletonweed has an extensive root system that allows it to outcompete native grasses and valuable crops for water. Major crops impacted include wheat and potatoes, both of which are major commodities in Washington. It has the potential to have a total economic impact of $149.2 million, putting 1,080 jobs at risk if it were allowed to spread an additional 12% per year into susceptible land types. Scotch broom quickly forms dense stands which quickly outcompete young trees and desirable forage plants. Furthermore, Scotch broom can be toxic to cattle. Scotch broom is widespread in western Washington and has the potential to cause a total of $142.7 million in lost sales and 660 job losses in Washington per year if it were allowed to spread an additional 12% per year into susceptible land types. Animal Species: Apple maggots infest apple, pear and cherry orchards, rendering significant numbers of fruit unsuitable for sale. Since apple maggot is an invasive species, any orchard infested with apple maggot cannot export any of its fruit without undergoing treatment. The total economic impact from apple maggot is estimated to be $392.5 million, putting 2,900 jobs at risk per year. Zebra mussels are not currently found in Washington but do have the potential to infest numerous bodies of water in the Columbia River Basin. Zebra mussels can clog intake valves in dams as well as colonize public boat launches, rendering them unusable. If zebra mussels were to establish in Washington, the economic impact could be as large as $100.1 million. This translates into an estimated loss of 500 jobs.",EN,,,2017,2017,Agriculture,Damage_costs,Site

Losses of livestock have been reduced by $3.7 million/year. Additional savings have accrued through increased productivity of pastures ($1.27 million/year) and by reducing herbicide use ($0.85 million/year). Control of ragwort was achieved at a cost of about $5/ha. Non-market benefits include return of desirable flora in habitats once dominated by ragwort and a reduction in herbicide in the environment. Several correlative observations substantiate evidence used in estimating benefits of the regional control of ragwort. In western Oregon, control of ragwort reduced propagule production, which correlated with a decline in the number of new infestations in eastern Oregon, despite increased detection efforts.

Models of leafy spurge patch expansion, infestation and grazing carrying capacity, infestation and wildlife habitat, and wildlife and wildlands were developed. Leafy spurge infestation results in an estimated direct annual impact of $40.5 million in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Impacts in North Dakota account for nearly 67 percent of the total. Total secondary impacts could be as high as $89 million per year and represent the potential loss of 1,433 jobs.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

SC1160,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC",2014,Official report,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Apiales,Apiaceae,Heracleum,Heracleum mantegazzianum,Giant hogweed,Terrestrial,North America,USA,Oregon,,Regional,1 year,Year,2012,2012,One-time,"1,434,000",1883000,1055000,1530970,"1,530,970",1434000,1530970,"1,530,970",USD,2012,Effective,Potential,Extrapolation,Agriculture/Environment/Forestry,Damage-Loss,High,"Noxious Weeds Regional Economic Impacts of  Susceptible Areas Measured by Direct Sales  Cost is from a model which models susceptible areas: The infestation susceptible area upper bound and lower bound correspond to area calculations for minus one standard deviation and plus one standard deviation, respectively",no,,N,NA,NA,NA,"Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1222,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC",2014,Official report,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Asteraceae,Chondrilla,Chondrilla juncea,Rush skeletonweed,Terrestrial,North America,USA,Oregon,,Regional,1 year,Year,2012,2012,One-time,"2,177,000",,,2324214,"2,324,214",2177000,2324214,"2,324,214",USD,2012,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Agriculture/Environment/Forestry,Damage-Loss,High,Noxious Weeds Regional Economic Impacts of  CURRENT Areas Measured by Direct Sales,no,,N,NA,NA,NA,"Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate.

For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.

standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one

The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.

4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture.

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).

The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

(All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC1733,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC",2014,Official report,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rosales,Rosaceae,Rubus,Rubus armeniacus,Armenian blackberry (Himalayan,Terrestrial,North America,USA,Oregon,,Regional,1 year,Year,2012,2012,One-time,"46,815,000",,,49980738,"49,980,738",46815000,49980738,"49,980,738",USD,2012,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Agriculture/Environment/Forestry,Damage-Loss,High,Noxious Weeds Regional Economic Impacts of  CURRENT Areas Measured by Direct Sales,no,,N,NA,NA,NA,"Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored.

Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.

While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.

standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one

2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following:

The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).

The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.

The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.

Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option. 

 
 xiii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
 
The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.

Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored.

ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored.

In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.

Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.

ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs

are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate. 
 
There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities.

There are five case studies that provide examples of control projects conducted by ODA.  Biological control and prevention programs are shown to be beneficial and can have a high return on the investment from these types of activities. 
 
The unintended spread of introduced species such as Scotch broom can turn them into undesirable plants in a very short time.  The costs of direct control, such as herbicides, are often substantial, especially in extensive rangeland environments.  Concerns about the cost effectiveness of chemical treatment and growing public concern about environmental safety have led to more research and use of insects or microorganisms that adversely affect the unwanted plant.  While more emphasis is being placed on biological controls, chemical or manual control in the early stages of invasion may also result in favorable cost effectiveness.  Programs for existing noxious weeds that are expensive to eradicate with manual or chemical means, and that have no potential biological control agents, may not evaluate financially favorable.  In such cases, education about containment may be the only option.

The control and spread of noxious weeds are of public concern because of a private market externality problem.  The background research and maintenance costs can be prohibitive for any single individual or even single industry.  A public agency may need to be involved when private party culpability and enforcement processes are not adequate for controlling invasions.  Once control programs have been established, the private businesses will become a free rider to the benefits of the program in the case the weed is deleterious to commercial production.  Depending on harm caused by particular weeds, the public will also benefit from control programs through greater recreational use opportunity.  In either case, there is a gain in social values from knowing ecosystems are being restored. 
 
ODA serves as a leader in protecting natural and agricultural resources from the introduction and spread of noxious weeds.  ODA approaches noxious weed control with an integrated, multidisciplinary approach.  Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is a decision making process based on the best available science and experience of weed managers.  Control options depend on site-specific information and the best strategy or combinations of strategies for effective management decisions.  IWM uses all available methods and techniques for noxious weed control including prevention, mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological control. 
 
There are many entities involved in noxious weed management in Oregon including state and federal agencies, county weed control programs, cooperative weed management areas, and universities.  The Oregon Invasive Species Council serves to protect Oregon's natural resources from invasive species thorough coordination efforts.  Other regional and national groups are engaged to increase awareness, address policy needs, and direct resources toward invasive plant control.  Government agencies and universities contribute through research services, sponsored prevention and control operations, financial incentive grants, and punitive regulations.

SC983,,Oregon2014,Economic Impact From Selected Noxious Weeds in Oregon,"The Research Group, LLC",2014,Official report,NA,Yes,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Brassicales,Brassicaceae,Lepidium,Lepidium draba,White top (hoary cress),Terrestrial,North America,USA,Oregon,,Regional,1 year,Year,2012,2012,One-time,"559,000",,,596801,"596,801",559000,596801,"596,801",USD,2012,Effective,Observed,Report/Estimation,Public and social welfare,Damage-Loss,High,Cost of various invasive species on Personal Income.,no,,N,NA,NA,NA,"Noxious weeds are depriving Oregon agriculture and other natural resource industries of significant revenues.  This causes adverse economic impacts to Oregon's economy.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Control Program (ODA) contracted with The Research Group, LLC (TRG) in Corvallis to conduct an economic impact study for current and potential infestations of specific noxious weeds on Oregon rangelands, farmlands, forestlands, and wildlands.  The study is distinctive in that it incorporates Oregon WeedMapper software program results for existing invasions, which was analyzed along with other environmental variables using a unique geospatial analysis model to provide noxious weed habitat suitability data for potential infestations. 
 
The study found there is an estimated annual loss of almost $83.5 million personal income to the State's economy from 25 selected weed species.  (All referenced values in the study are adjusted to 2012 dollars.)  That is the equivalent to the loss of about 1,900 jobs in the private sector.  If left unchecked, there is a potential annual loss of $1.8 billion personal income and 40,800 jobs.  Two of the 25 selected weeds, Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom, are widespread and contribute $79.6 million to the current overall economic impact.  The remaining 23 species are limited in distribution and are under intensive management thus contributing to less than five percent of total current impacts. 
 
The purpose of this current study is to update a previous similar study of noxious weeds found in Oregon.  Case descriptions for several individual species are documented to bring clarity for how different prevention and control programs are utilized and have demonstrated success.  Government policy implications for providing noxious weed research and control program services are discussed.  In particular, the current study provides an opportunity for ODA to look at the impacts of two widespread invasive weeds (Armenian blackberry and Scotch broom) and address the potential economic impact of up and coming noxious weeds.  The study reveals the benefits of having safeguards such as biological, prevention, and other control programs in place to minimize impacts. 
 
The noxious weeds selected for the analysis contain all but one of the previous study's weeds, two grouped together, and six additional species for a total of 25 weeds.  This economic analysis is limited to measurements of regional economic impacts (REI) using the metrics for business sales, personal income, and jobs.  This economic analysis distilled the selected weeds into 15 unique economic model groupings.  The marginal REI calculations for the groupings can be used to calculate a new weed's economic impacts. 
 
The economic impact information is supplemented with explanations and estimated unit costs for different control approaches including none; prevention; early detection and rapid response (EDRR); and, long-term maintenance.  The cost discussions when related to the economic impact results provide illuminating information about the importance of control programs.  However, the provided economic impact information in the current study is not from a formal benefit-cost analysis (BCA).  The REI measure tells us an immediate with or without change in economic activity.  A BCA deals with the time value of money where sometimes one-time costs 

 
 xi D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
are incurred today, but net economic benefits accrue far into the future.  A BCA can include externality effects or changed societal values, and a BCA can account for the positive benefits as well as the foregone economic activity.  The disadvantage of a BCA is that the measurement can lack tangibility and authenticity.  The public and decision makers are generally only provided simple benefit-to-cost ratios and other summary indexes without knowing assumptions and methods. 
 
A properly conducted BCA will show whether the net economic benefits for a single weed control project make it worth undertaking a control program given commercial and recreational production to be recovered or preserved.  For example, the previous study found that biological control of tansy ragwort has a $13 return for every $1 investment and prevention programs have a benefit to cost ratio of 34 to one. 
 
The assumed affected economic activities for the analyzed weed species were associated with the previous study four land types: 
 
1. Rangelands:  livestock loss, reduced cattle foraging, and reduced wildlife grazing. 
2. Farmlands:  seed loss, decreased other agriculture, and reduced aquaculture. 
3. Forestland:  reduced timber production. 
4. Wildlands:  wildlife and fish stressor that lowers hunting, fishing, and boating recreational uses. 
 
Economic model parameters specific to the analyzed weeds include the following: 
 
1. Plant coverage factor.  The share of the infested areas that affects a particular economic activity. 
2. Degradation factor of the economic activity.  This factor can have various interpretations depending on the economic activity.  For example, it could be interpreted as a cow mortality rate for the livestock economic activity.  The assigned degradation factors are different for an economic activity affected for a particular analyzed noxious weed located on a particular land type.  The factors are normalized to apply to an economic activity and are usually expressed as a percent. 
3. Land production factors.  The factors are an assignment based on the land use for livestock, other agriculture, timber, or wildlife management. 
 
The geospatial analysis model developed to show current and potential area infestations is titled Kinetic Resource and Environmental Spatial System (KRESS).  Its output was the potential range across Oregon for the 25 selected weeds.  The modeling was based on the weeds' currently known locations, and their relationship with environmental and elevation variables.  A post KRESS outcome factor was applied to forestry susceptible areas to account for land management set asides for non-timber production.  The KRESS models utilized the Oregon WeedMapper dataset, which is comprised of 300,000 known weed infestations across the state.  The KRESS input data is collected through partnerships with non-profit, local, county and federal agencies.  The KRESS determined mean predicted area was bounded with confidence intervals of one 

 
 xii D:\Data\Documents\swd\nox weed13 report.docx 
standard deviation to provide a statistical measure of precision.  Potential weed ranges were compared against different land uses capable of being degraded by noxious weeds.  The eight land types in the KRESS model were mapped to the four land types used in the economic activity modeling. 
 
Of the estimated foregone economic activity from current levels of noxious weed infestations ($83.5 million personal income and about 1.9 thousand jobs), the economic impact shares from the analyzed species three largest contributors (in order) are:  Armenian blackberry 48 percent, Scotch broom 47 percent, and rush skeletonweed two percent.  The current study economic impacts without the six additional analyzed species are $43.1 million, which compares to the previous study $101.5 million.  The decrease would be an indicator of success in the containment efforts for the previous study's analyzed species. 
 
The estimated economic impact of the analyzed species would be between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion personal income if infestation moved into the susceptible areas.  The point estimate for mean within this range would represent 40.8 thousand jobs.  The three analyzed species with the largest contributions for susceptible areas are:  Armenian blackberry 15 percent, rush skeletonweed 12 percent, and gorse 11 percent.  For the six species analyzed for susceptible areas in the previous study (tansy ragwort, distaff thistle, leafy spurge, purple starthistle, hawkweeds, and spartina), the current study economic impacts from susceptible areas is $305.0 million as compared to the previous study $68.7 million.  While methods differ between the two studies on the estimation of susceptible habitat, an inference is that there is a growing threat from the six species. 
 
The results are from complex methodological calculations that have high uncertainty.  For example, the species with the second highest economic loss threat of the 25 analyzed species is Scotch broom.  The current infestation share of lost economic activity for this species is $39.5 million personal income.  The important lost economic activity associated with this species is from timber production degradation following invasion.  An uncertainty analysis shows a 42 percent increase in the degradation factor and susceptible area would about double the lost income over the current study estimate.

In a case study of alien, invasive weeds on public lands in Nevada, we estimate economic impacts from reduced recreation expected ranging from $6 to $12 million per year.

A prime example of this phenomenon is the cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) invasion of the native shrub-steppe lands in Great Basin of the western United States. The purpose of this study is to develop a bioeconomic model that optimizes simulated ranch behavior given the beginning stages of cheatgrass invasion on a public forage allotment. The bioeconomic model is applied to a typical eastern Oregon 300 cow-calf ranch. Livestock production decisions are simulated over a 40-yr planning horizon using a multiperiod linear programming model. Results showed changes in profit-maximizing ranch management strategies in the form of decreased optimal stocking rates and forage substitution. The net present value of the simulated ranch’s income stream declined, and the probability that the ranch cannot meet its full costs of livestock production and would exit the industry increased as a result. These economic impacts were more pronounced with decreased sale price. Sensitivity analysis showed that overall results in terms of ranch behavior were specific neither to the assumed discount rate nor to the assumed percentage of cheatgrass cover (as long as this percentage is within the reference state) on the public grazing allotment. This study introduces a method for managers to quantify impacts on ranches from fuel-altering invasive plants on public lands, emphasizing the importance of including information about native and invasive forage production characteristics and wildfire frequency as a function of the state of invasion.",EN,,,2013,2053,Agriculture,Damage_costs,Site

inland lakes should be easily established because most AIS are initially introduced into watersheds by recreational boating activities,
especially in North America. The Watershed Management Plan for Otsego Lake, a central New York glacial lake, provides for
prevention of AIS via a stringent boat inspection and washing program (BIP). All boats entering Otsego Lake at the public launch
are visually inspected and those deemed likely to harbor AIS are required to power wash before launching. However, other sites are
available to launch boats. BIP expenses average $30,000 per year, much of which has been covered by collecting a launch fee. After
implementation of the BIP, only one boat was refused access, and less than 1% required washing before allowed access, however,
zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and water chestnut (Trapa natans) have since been found in the lake. The BIP continues to be
supported because other AIS may have been prevented or may be prevented in the future.",EN,,,2003,2003,Mixed,Mixed_costs,Unit

As with other integrated management systems for weeds, the use of fire to manage invasive weeds must be integrated with other tools, such as seeding, to provide competition to ward off recovering weed species and allow for completion of land management goals and objectives. Burning mixed brush-cheatgrass stands destroys some to many weed seeds and allows about one season of desirable vegetation to establish before cheatgrass re-establishes and dominates the site again (Evans and Young 1978; Young and Evans 1978; Young 2000). Establishing competitive perennial grass species may successfully keep cheatgrass from re-establishing. If, however, the system is left alone after burning, cheatgrass or medusahead will re-invade.

Burning stands of a perennial weed, such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) and other knapweeds, or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), is rarely effective because of the plants’ ability to re-grow from its root system and dominate a site again.

Burning stands of a perennial weed, such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) and other knapweeds, or tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), is rarely effective because of the plants’ ability to re-grow from its root system and dominate a site again.

Labor is the most expensive portion of a weed management project. It is incumbent upon land managers to use methods that minimize labor costs, and this is especially so with public land managers because they are dependent upon tax dollars to execute their programs. Using herbicides and biological control agents to decrease the population abundance of a target invasive weed are approaches that utilize the least labor to affect initial and continued reduction of the target species. Because biocontrol is developed using public funds, it seems inexpensive to the end user, which includes federal agencies. Biocontrol is a very attractive and highly useful approach to control invasive weed species, however, success has been inconsistent in space and time. There are numerous successful biocontrol endeavors and the literature offers many examples. The USDA Forest Service’s Fire Effects Information System website (www. fs.fed.us/database/feis/) is one of the best and most complete information sources for the biology and management of many invasive weed species. Another outstanding source of information on managing invasive weeds which recently became available is Weed Control in Natural Areas in the Western United States (Joseph DiTomaso et al., 2013: University of California Weed Research and Information Center). It too describes where and upon what species biocontrol has been successful and extensively outlines all management options. If biocontrol is the method selected, land managers must carefully research choices for their effectiveness. The spatial and temporal variation associated with biocontrol performance may be due to many genetic and environmental reasons—from habitat preference by the biocontrol agent to the production of new genotypes from previously geographically separated genotypes now growing in proximity to one another, and many as yet to be discovered reasons. Fire too can be a good tool to decrease populations (DiTomaso et al. 2006) of some invasive weeds, most notably annual grasses and forbs such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). As with other integrated management systems for weeds, the use of fire to manage invasive weeds must be integrated with other tools, such as seeding, to provide competition to ward off recovering weed species and allow for completion of land management goals and objectives. Burning mixed brush-cheatgrass stands destroys some to many weed seeds and allows about one season of desirable vegetation to establish before cheatgrass re-establishes and dominates the site again (Evans and Young 1978; Young and Evans 1978; Young 2000).

However, the costs and benefits of using sentinel chickens in noncommercial operations are in question. The objective of this study was to use sentinel chickens to evaluate whether adequate cleaning and disinfection coupled with an appropriate time period without susceptible poultry species on the premises would eliminate END virus from a noncommercial poultry operation and preclude the need for placement of sentinels in previously infected operations before declaring them free of virus. Noncommercial poultry operations were selected from the 2002 to 2003 END outbreak database. Operations included in the study had one or more isolations of END virus (ENDV) from cloacal or oropharyngeal swabs of birds on the premises. A total of 546 birds were placed on 53 premises. All sentinel birds sampled after placements were negative by virus detection methods and serologic tests. Results of this study indicate that time and the application of appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures will adequately mitigate the risk of viable virus persisting in noncommercial poultry operations. In the future, this information may eliminate the need for sentinel bird placement to ensure virus free status of premises before repopulation, thereby decreasing the costs of END eradication.",EN,,,1978,1978,Authorities-Stakeholders,Mixed_costs,Site

We present the results of a survey of ranchers, local decision makers, and public land managers of grazing and nongrazing property from a five-county area in North and South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming. A total of 565 ranchers, local decision makers, and public land managers were surveyed, which resulted in 267 completed questionnaires. The main objective of the survey was to evaluate respondent's per- spectives of managerial, institutional, and social factors that may affect the rate and extent of implementation of various E esula control strategies. The reasons for not using the various E esula controls generally fell into environmental, financial, and educational categories. In many cases, little can be done to remove environmental constraints; however, financial constraints may be addressed through cost-share pro- grams either offered locally or through state agencies. The other main reason for not using some controls was a lack of knowledge to work with various controls (e.g., grazing and biological controls). These obstacles could be addressed with workshops, demonstrations, or educational bulletins. These educational tools could be provided by universities or governmental agencies, as respondents indicated this was their choice for information dissemination.

Ecological models of invasive plant spread and control provide a practical tool with which to evaluate alternative management strategies at landscape scales. We developed a spatially explicit model for the spread and control of spotted knapweed and leafy spurge across three Montana landscapes. The objective of the model was to determine the ecological and economic costs and benefits of alternative strategies across landscapes of varying size and stages of infestation. Our results indicate that (1) in the absence of management the area infested will continue to increase exponentially leading to a substantial cost in foregone grazing revenues; (2) even though the costs of management actions are substantial, there is a net economic benefit associated with a broad range of management strategies; (3) strategies a that prioritize targeting small new infestations consistently outperform strategies that target large established patches; and (4) inconsistent treatment and short-term delays can greatly reduce the economic and ecological benefits of management.

Swine have spread from Europeand Russia to habitats around the world via human introduction. Currently, feral swine populations are established on every continent except Antarctica.  Unlike other large mammal invaders, swine have a high reproductive capacity and are omnivorous, which allows for a quick assimilation into most habitats.  Once a breeding population is established in an area, the population can quickly increase and negatively impact the ecosystem. A successful invasion of feral swine is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to reverse.  A feral swine pest risk assessment for Oregon, released in 2004, designated feral swine as a very high-risk species due to high potential for establishment, environmental and economic impacts, and disease transmission to wildlife, livestock and humans. Economic impacts on ecosystems and disease transmission to wildlife are difficult to assess, but restoration of ecosystems and losses to agriculture and livestock have been estimated to exceed US$800 million in the United States each year. Environmental impacts include facilitation of noxious weed invasions, shifts in dominant plant species, reduction of forest regeneration, and soil erosion.  Facilitation of noxious weeds and erosion due to feral swine rooting are documented in Oregon. Feral swine in Oregon have not been implicated in disease transmission to humans, but the recent E. coli outbreak from spinach grown on a California farm that caused three deaths has been genetically traced to feral swine excrement deposited in spinach fields. The feral swine population in Oregon is currently small and dispersed.  Few disturbances have been documented but state and federal biologists report regular occurrence of disturbances due to feral swine.  Actions to prevent the effects of an invasion fall into three categories: management, control or eradication. Of the three categories, only eradication efforts have successfully slowed or reversed the effects of swine invasions.  Case studies from California, Australia, Hawaii, the Galapagos Islandsand the Channel Islands off the coast of California show that management and control efforts, while effective in the short term, have not successfully kept small feral swine populations from increasing to levels that are unmanageable and uncontrollable.",EN,,,2007,2011,Authorities-Stakeholders,Mixed_costs,Site

Latent class approach was used to assess the surveyed population to see the different preferences by individual classes. The results show three different classes or groups of individuals with varying preferences for a control program of which cost and erosion were the top preferred attributes among the classes. These groups were deﬁned by their socio-demographics of income, the length of residency and exposure to farming/gardeningactivities.Evenwithapreferenceforlower cost, a group showed willingness to pay more ($2.40) for a program that reduces erosion from high to low.

The disease causes losses of yield and closure of some export markets. The U.S. government introduced an eradication policy in which growers are required to remove infected trees and receive compensation payments for doing so. Recent hurricanes
have spread the disease and re-established it. This chapter examines the economic impacts of citrus
canker in oranges and the eradication policy in Florida, taking into account the relationship between costs
and benefits of eradication and the spatial and dynamic aspects of infestation. We evaluate both the costs
of the disease and the benefits from eradication. In this evaluation we consider the implications of a future
hurricane, which spreads citrus canker, for the decision about whether to adopt a strategy of eradicating
initially, or after the hurricane, or both. We find that producers as a group benefit from both the disease
and the eradication program, but at the expense of taxpayers, consumers and the nation as a whole.
Producers benefit at the expense of consumers because both the disease and the policy to eradicate it
reduce supply and drive up the price and the gross value of production. Producers also benefit at the
expense of taxpayers, who pay to compensate them for their losses for having to remove trees under the

However, one of the unintended side effects of such introductions is that the exotic plant species may become invasive. Prohibiting sale of this type of exotic plant species, on the basis that it may become invasive, will have social costs in the form of foregone consumer benefits and nursery profits. We develop a model of a private commercial plant breeding industry that imports an exotic plant species into a region. The risk associated with invasion is modeled using a probabilistic ‘hazard function’, the key determinants of which are the characteristics of the exotic plant and the number of commercial nurseries contributing to its dispersal. We consider the possibility of employing market-based instruments (e.g., Pigovian tax) consistent with the concept of ‘introducers pay’, to regulate the nursery industry. We then provide an empirical illustration using the historical introduction of saltcedar (Tamarisk spp.) into the United States. Our results indicate that the mere presence of a risk of invasion does not mean that it is socially optimal to prevent commercial sales of an exotic plant species. Indeed, there appear to be plausible forms of the functional relationships involved that require only a modest reduction in the private industry optimum. In contrast, no sales of the exotic plant should occur at all under several sets of assumptions about the level of invasion risk and the linkage between dispersal sites and invasion hazard.",EN,,,2005,2005,Mixed,Damage_costs,Country

The aggregate cost of milfoil invading one additional lake in the study area is, on average, $377,542 USD per year. Our study illustrates that invasive aquatic plants can significantly impact property values (and associated losses in property taxes that reduce local government revenue), justifying the need for management strategies that prevent and control invasions.

After accounting for structural (e.g., house size), locational (e.g., boat launch), and environmental characteristics (e.g., water clarity) of lakes, we found that milfoil has a significant negative effect on property sales price ($94,385 USD lower price), corresponding to a 19% decline in mean property values. The aggregate cost of milfoil invading one additional lake in the study area is, on average, $377,542 USD per year. Our study illustrates that invasive aquatic plants can significantly impact property values (and associated losses in property taxes that reduce local government revenue), justifying the need for management strategies that prevent and control invasions. We recommend coordinated efforts across Lake Management Districts to focus institutional support, funding, and outreach to prevent the introduction and spread of milfoil. This effort will limit opportunities for re-introduction from neighboring lakes and incentivize private landowners and natural resource agencies to commit time and funding to invasive species management.",EN,,,1995,2006,Public and social welfare,Damage_costs,Unit

About three-quarters of all domestic livestock depend upon grazing lands for survival. Many ranges have had domestic stock grazing for more than 100 years and, as a result, the plant composition has changed greatly from the original ecosystems. Western rangelands previously dominated by perennial bunchgrasses have been converted, primarily through overgrazing, to annual grasslands that are susceptible to invasion by introduced dicots. Today there are more than 300 rangeland weeds in the United States. Some of the most problematic include Bromus tectorum, Euphorbia esula, Centaurea solstitialis, C. diffusa, C. maculosa, and a number of other Centaurea species. In total, weeds in rangeland cause an estimated loss of $2 billion annually in the United States, which is more than all other pests combined. They impact the livestock industry by lowering yield and quality of forage, interfering with grazing, poisoning animals, increasing costs of managing and producing livestock, and reducing land value. They also impact wildlife habitat and forage, deplete soil and water resources, and reduce plant and animal diversity. Numerous mechanical and cultural control options have been developed to manage noxious rangeland weeds, including mowing, prescribed burning, timely grazing, and perennial grass reseeding or interseeding. In addition, several herbicides are registered for use on rangelands and most biological control programs focus on noxious rangeland weed control. Successful management of noxious weeds on rangeland will require the development of a long-term strategic plan incorporating prevention programs, education materials and activities, and economical and sustainable multi-year integrated approaches that improve degraded rangeland communities, enhance the utility of the ecosystem, and prevent reinvasion or encroachment by other noxious weed species.

Controlling reed is a priority of many wetland managers because habitat homogenization from reed expansion may adversely aff ect wildlife habitat and waterfowl. Reed has historically been a minor part of wetland plant communities of the Laurentian Great Lakes but has spread rapidly since 2000 when lake water levels dropped. Here we examined ODNR records and aerial photographs using ArcGIS so— ware and planimetry from 2000 to 2007 to (1) track annual changes in reed localities and areal coverage, (2) compare short-term eff ectiveness of glyphosate (Glypro® and AquaNeat®) and imazapyr (Habitat®) herbicides, and (3) estimate control costs. Reed › rst appeared in a small, isolated patch in 1998 but expanded to comprise approximately 18 percent of the marsh’s emergent vegetation by 2001. Annual change in areal cover was not related to minor changes in already low Lake Erie water levels. However, reed amount decreased from 6.7 ha (= 14.8 percent of emergent vegetation) in 2004 to 2.5 ha in 2007 a— er a two- to three-fold annual increase in amount of herbicide used.  Short-term, post-spraying necrosis (browning) was slower for Phragmites treated with a › ve percent Habitat® solution than with a 30 percent AquaNeat® solution. Slowed necrosis presumably prolongs photosynthesis and plant nutrient uptake and delays habitat deterioration for some wildlife, but provides time for vegetative spread. Seven years of herbiciding have contained reed to approximately six percent of the emergent plant cover. Estimated control expenditures from 2003 to 2007 were $8475 USD (average approximately $1700/year); a small cost to maintain system ecological diversity.",EN,,,2003,2008,Authorities-Stakeholders,Mixed_costs,Unit

On average one new species has become established every 36 weeks since 1850, increasing to one new species every 24 weeks since 1970. Nonidigenous species have altered habitats, disrupted food webs, and contributed to the eradication or reduction of native populations. Some intentionally introduced fish and two accidentally introduced clams supported commercial fisheries that have since declined or closed. Most economic effects have been negative, including over $600 million damage from a wood-boring clam, reduced vessel speed and increased fuel consumption from hull fouling, and costs of controlling nonindigenous plants and fish.

Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.).  Using data from USDA Forest Service’s 
Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA), and USGS Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), I first used logistic regressions to build occupation models for these four species.  Second, I used VB.NET© (Microsoft, 2003) and Environment System Research Institute (ESRI) Arc View® 9.2 Geographical 
Information System (GIS) to model spatially explicit dispersal dynamics of these 
species.  Finally, I evaluated economic losses associated with these invasions.  The 
results of occupation models showed that landscape features, climatic conditions, forest 
and site conditions, forest management activities and disturbances, and forest ownership 
have statistically significant impacts on current distributions of all four species.  The 
 iv 
results of dispersal models showed that invasions of Chinese tallow, Chinese and 
European privets, and Japanese honeysuckle will be likely to appear on approximately 
6.65 million acres of forest land in East Texas and Louisiana, 3.81 million acres in 
Mississippi and Alabama, and 12.55 million acres in Mississippi and Alabama, 
respectively, during the next 20 years.  The estimated timber losses resulting from the 
invasion with no control for the next 20 years at 5% discount rate is 518 million dollars 
for Chinese tallow, 2.72 billion dollars for Chinese and European privets, and 11.05 
billion dollars for Japanese honeysuckle.  From an economic point of view, it would be 
most cost effective to execute high intensity control for these invasive species.  Based on 
these findings, strategies for monitoring and mitigating these invasive species are 
proposed. ",EN,,,2011,2031,Forestry,Damage_costs,Regional

6.65 million acres of forest land in East Texas and Louisiana, 3.81 million acres in 
Mississippi and Alabama, and 12.55 million acres in Mississippi and Alabama, 
respectively, during the next 20 years.  The estimated timber losses resulting from the 
invasion with no control for the next 20 years at 5% discount rate is 518 million dollars 
for Chinese tallow, 2.72 billion dollars for Chinese and European privets, and 11.05 
billion dollars for Japanese honeysuckle.  From an economic point of view, it would be 
most cost effective to execute high intensity control for these invasive species.  Based on

quantifying current distribution, rate of dispersals, and economic losses caused by four 
major invaders — Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera (L.) Small), Chinese Privet 
(Ligustrum sinense Lour.), European Privet (Ligustrum vulgare L.), and Japanese 
Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.).  Using data from USDA Forest Service’s 
Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA), and USGS Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), I first used logistic regressions to build occupation models for these four species.  Second, I used VB.NET© (Microsoft, 2003) and Environment System Research Institute (ESRI) Arc View® 9.2 Geographical 
Information System (GIS) to model spatially explicit dispersal dynamics of these 
species.  Finally, I evaluated economic losses associated with these invasions.  The 
results of occupation models showed that landscape features, climatic conditions, forest 
and site conditions, forest management activities and disturbances, and forest ownership 
have statistically significant impacts on current distributions of all four species.  The 
 iv 
results of dispersal models showed that invasions of Chinese tallow, Chinese and 
European privets, and Japanese honeysuckle will be likely to appear on approximately

unprecedented negative effect on the marshes and ecology of the Chesapeake Bay. Since
their introduction in the 1930's, nutria populations have continued to expand. With their
high reproductive rate and voracious appetite for marsh grasses and root mats, they are
now damaging hundreds of acres of valuable wetlands each year and turning oncevegetated
areas into mudflats and open-water. These denuded areas no longer provide
rich spawning and nursery grounds and habitat for the many species of shellfish, fish and
wildlife that this region is known for. Although the effects of nutria cannot be easily
separated from other detrimental factors, they are widely believed to be a large
contributing cause of the decline in the quality and extent of Chesapeake Bay wetlands.
As more and more acres of Chesapeake Bay marshes are lost, the resulting declines in
commercially and recreationally-valuable species takes a measurable economic toll on
the State ofMaiyland and its citizens. Commercial harvesting of shellfish and finfish,
sport hunting and fishing, and wildlife viewing in Maryland all have strong connections
to the wetlands of the Chesapeake and these sectors suffer as the marshes deteriorate. In
order to assess the economic effects this decline represents, this report analyzed scientific
literature, expert opinions and economic indices for commercial and recreational uses of
marshland and marsh-associated species in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay.
If marshes continue to be lost at the current rate, the financial losses to the State of
Maryland and its citizens are summarized in Table E-1 and E-2, below. In Table E-1, it
is clear that the direct losses due to declines in commercially and recreationally-valued
species alone are considerable annually and over the next 50 years. In Table E-2, it is
demonstrated that the losses in environmental services provided by wetlands, and the
associated social losses add another layer to the costs.   Taken together, the figures represented in Tables E-1 and E-2 present a challenge to the
State of Maryland and its citizens. These losses can be mitigated and lessened
considerably if marsh loss is slowed by removal of nutria. Otherwise, the economic
ramifications of damage to Chesapeake Bay marshes in the past and into the future are
costly and will continue to increase unless the necessary actions are taken. The costs of
nutria removal are potentially minor compared to the costs to the State if the loss of

now damaging hundreds of acres of valuable wetlands each year and turning oncevegetated

of sites in western Nevada and northeastern California, including Lake Tahoe. Because Eurasian
watermilfoil is easily spread by fragments, transport on boats and boating equipment plays a key
role in contaminating new water bodies. This is an important means of the potential spread of this
weed throughout key recreational and agricultural areas surrounding Lake Tahoe. Unless the weed
is controlled, significant alterations of aquatic ecosystems, with associated degradation of natural
resources and economic damages to human uses of those resources, may occur. This research uses
the economic valuation approach known as benefits transfer to estimate the value of a portion of the
recreational service flows that society currently enjoys in the Truckee River watershed below Lake
Tahoe. The lower-bound estimates of baseline water-based recreation value at a subset of sites in the
watershed range from $30 to $45 million/yr. Impacts from the continued spread of Eurasian watermilfoil
in the watershed could be significant; for example, even a 1% decrease in recreation values
would correspond to roughly $500,000/yr as a lower bound.",EN,,,2000,2000,Authorities-Stakeholders,Mixed_costs,Site

other species can move or be moved around the planet. As a result, exotic species have been
accidentally or intentionally introduced to non-native areas, many of which have become
invasive. Consequently, vast sums of money are spent each year to control the spread of
invasive species and to address their adverse effects on ecosystems and the economy.
Generally, the costs of invasive species are estimated based on the costs of managing
species invasions, including the amount that must be spent to repair infrastructure damage.
However, this is a conservative estimate of the social costs associated with invasive species as
they also affect biodiversity, ecosystems, and other environmental amenities whose values are
not readily observed in a market. Relatively little economic research has been done concerning
the non-market effects of invasive species.
The purpose of this study is to estimate a hedonic pricing model of lakeshore property
values to quantify the economic costs of a common aquatic invasive species, Eurasian
watermilfoil (EWM), across an extensive lake system in the northern forest region of Wisconsin.
The hedonic pricing model is estimated using a database on property sales and lake-specific
characteristics over the period 1997-2006.
While the primary purpose of the hedonic analysis is to isolate the price effect associated
with the presence and abundance of EWM, two major econometric challenges arise: spatial
autocorrelation and the endogeneity of EWM. Spatial autocorrelation arises due to the fact that
the prices associated with multiple parcels on the same lake are likely to be influenced by similar
unobserved lake-specific characteristics. Endogeneity problems arise because EWM is typically
spread by the movement of recreational boaters, where boaters are more likely to visit lakes with
attractive characteristics. To the extent that the attractiveness of a lake is unobserved to the
analyst, EWM will be correlated with the error term in the hedonic model and OLS estimation
will produce coefficient estimates that are positively biased.
Both issues are accounted for, in part, by defining each lake as a natural neighborhood
and estimating a fixed effect for each lake within the model. The endogeneity of EWM is further
accounted for by exploiting recent EWM invasions as a natural experiment with a difference-indifference
approach to hedonic analysis. Since only a portion of properties in the data set are
affected by EWM, this methodology is useful for identifying the unbiased effect of EWM,
eliminating any differences that may have been present before its introduction. Thus, the
methodology used requires a panel data set to ensure observations are present both before and
after the introduction of EWM.
Results indicate that lakes invaded with EWM experienced an average decrease in land
values by 13% after invasion. The EWM results are robust across linear and non-linear
specifications. This study addresses a topic that is both unique to the current environmental
economics literature and yet widely important for all natural resource management. Despite the
documented prevalence and detrimental effects of EWM, the associated economic and social
costs are yet to be understood. In addition, the econometric challenges seen in this study are
highly relevant to the field in general, particularly with the growing focus on spatial
econometrics. Solutions for the issues of spatial autocorrelation and endogeneity remain elusive.
The spatial difference-in-difference specification presented in this study offers a unique solution
to these challenges, yet is simple enough to be estimated with linear regression techniques.",EN,,,2006,2006,Authorities-Stakeholders,Damage_costs,Regional

Invasive plants infest 96% of the 445 public lakes and rivers inventoried in 2006 that comprise 1.26 million acres of fresh water where fishing alone is valued at over $1.5 billion annually. Once established, eradicating invasive plants is difficult or impossible and very expensive; therefore, continuous maintenance is critical to sustaining navigation, flood control, and recreation while conserving native plant habitat on sovereignty state lands, at the lowest feasible cost. The floating, non-native water hyacinth and water lettuce are two of the world’s fastest growing plants. These invasive plants, that once covered more than 125,000 acres of Florida’s public waters, are the BIPM’s highest management priority. Floating plants covered 5,580 acres in the 276 waters in which they were detected during 2006; an 8,800- acre reduction from 2005. 99% of Florida’s public waters are under maintenance control in regards to invasive floating plants. About $3.6 million were spent controlling nearly 37,100 acres of floating plants in FY 05-06. 81% of the floating plant coverage was in Lake Okeechobee and the St Johns and Kissimmee Rivers and their tributaries. Intensive management efforts are underway to bring these systems under control. Hydrilla, a submersed invasive species introduced from Southeast Asia in the 1950s, dispersed throughout the state impacting nearly 140,000 acres by the early 1990s. Dense mats form at the water surface blocking navigation, jamming against bridges, starving fish of oxygen, and hampering flood control. Increased control efforts from improved, recurring funds under the Florida Forever Act, along with wave action and increased turbidity from three hurricanes in 2004 reduced the hydrilla standing crop to 20,409 in 2005 - the lowest level since the BIPM began conducting inventories in 1983. However, underground tubers that can sprout and blanket waters within one year, still infest an estimated 91,000 acres. Hydrilla, which has been recorded in as many as 346 public water bodies during the previous 23 years, was detected in 202 waters in 2006. Hydrilla cover increased to about 31,800 acres in 2006; however, hydrilla is considered to be under maintenance control in 96% of Florida’s public waters. Approximately $8.5 million were spent managing 17,800 acres of hydrilla in public waters in FY 05-06. These figures represent an increase of about 20% in the acres controlled and 15% in control expenditures over the previous year reflecting the recovery from 2004 hurricane-related disturbances. As water levels dropped and water clarity improved, hydrilla began to recover, requiring increasing statewide maintenance efforts. Nine additional invasive plants collectively infest 85% of Florida’s public waters covering about 18,200 acres. More than $9.1 million were spent managing other plants in FY 05-06, including invasive exotics as well as rooted native plants that interfered with uses and functions of Florida public waters. Floating islands generated from increased water levels and hurricanes in the early 2000s created problems with navigation, flood control, recreation, habitat and even human safety. $8.6 million were spent controlling floating islands in both FY 04-05 and FY 05-06. This intensive management combined with receding water levels in the latter half of 2006 have substantially reduced floating island-related problems as well as the funding required to manage them. Approximately $29.0 million are needed for FY 07-08 to manage invasive exotic aquatic plants and floating islands; $16 million to sustain control and improve upon hydrilla maintenance strategies; $3.5 million to control floating plants; and $9.5 million to manage other invasive plants including drifting, floating islands in Florida public waters.",EN,,,2006,2006,Authorities-Stakeholders,Mixed_costs,Site

The authority of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) as addressed in §369.20 (5), Florida Statutes, extends to the management of nuisance populations of all aquatic plants, both indigenous and nonindigenous, and in all waters accessible to the general public. The aquatic plant management program in Florida’s public waters involves complex operational and financial interactions between state, federal and local governments as well as private sector companies. A summary of plant acres controlled in sovereignty public waters and associated expenditures contracted or monitored by the DEP during Fiscal Year 2006-2007 is presented in the tables on page 42 of this report. Florida’s aquatic plant management program mission is to reduce negative impacts from invasive nonindigenous plants like water hyacinth, water lettuce and hydrilla to conserve the multiple uses and functions of public lakes and rivers. Invasive plants infest 95 percent of the 437 public waters inventoried in 2007 that comprise 1.25 million acres of fresh water where fishing alone is valued at more than $1.5 billion annually. Once established, eradicating invasive plants is difficult or impossible and very expensive; therefore, continuous maintenance is critical to sustaining navigation, flood control and recreation while conserving native plant habitat on sovereignty state lands at the lowest feasible cost. The floating, non-native water hyacinth and water lettuce are two of the world’s fastest growing plants. These invasive plants, that once covered more than 125,000 acres of Florida’s public waters, are the DEP’s highest management priority. Floating plants covered a combined 3,342 acres in the 247 waters in which they were detected during 2007 - a 2,200-acre reduction from 2006 and an 11,000-acre reduction since 2005. About $3.5 million were spent controlling nearly 21,900 acres of floating plants in FY 06-07. Ninety-eight percent of Florida’s public waters are under maintenance control in regards to invasive floating plants. Efforts are underway to bring remaining systems like Lake Monroe, Shell Reservoir and the St. Johns, Hillsborough and Withlacoochee Rivers under control. Hydrilla, a submersed invasive species introduced from Southeast Asia in the 1950s, dispersed throughout the state impacting nearly 140,000 acres by the early 1990s. Dense mats form at the water surface blocking navigation, jamming against bridges, starving fish of oxygen and hampering flood control. Increased control efforts from improved, recurring funds since 2000, along with wave action and increased turbidity from three hurricanes in 2004, reduced the hydrilla standing crop to 20,400 in 2005. However, underground tubers that can sprout and blanket waters within one year still infest an estimated 81,400 acres. Hydrilla, which has been recorded in as many as 346 public water bodies during the previous 24 years, was detected in 199 waters in 2007. Hydrilla cover increased to about 45,400 acres in 2007. It is considered to be under maintenance control in 96 percent of Florida’s public waters. However, hydrilla is continuing a rapid recovery from the post hurricane year low, expanding in some of Florida’s largest and most important lakes including Toho, Orange, Lochloosa and Rousseau. Approximately $6.8 million were spent managing 13,569 acres of hydrilla in public waters in FY 06-07. This low effort of control is more reflective of the lack of costeffective, large-scale management tools available since the confirmation of increasing resistance to fluridone herbicide in hydrilla. Intense research and operational efforts during the past six years have lead to the development of new strategies that will be employed in an expanded level of hydrilla management in FY 07-08. Nine additional invasive plants collectively infest 88 percent of Florida’s public waters covering about 19,000 acres. More than $5.8 million were spent managing other plants in FY 06-07, including invasive exotics as well as native plants that interfered with uses and functions of Florida public waters. Approximately $29.7 million are needed for FY 08-09 to manage invasive exotic aquatic plants; $18 million to sustain current control levels and improve upon hydrilla maintenance strategies; $3.5 million to control floating plants; and $8.2 million to manage other invasive plants, especially torpedograss, in Florida public waters",EN,,,2007,2007,Authorities-Stakeholders,Mixed_costs,Site

a non-indigenous aquatic plant species. We used hedonic modeling to estimate the effects of
ambient water quality and the presence of Eurasian watermilfoil on lakefront property values

associated with Secchi depth (a proxy of water quality or clarity), and negatively related to the
presence of watermilfoil. Results of spatial regime analysis indicate the geographical variations of
these associations. The presence of watermilfoil was related to a 13% decline in mean property value,
corresponding to $64,255 USD, on average, lower property sales price. Our study demonstrates that
proactive mitigation approaches to cope with potential environmental degradation in lake ecosystems

The results from Tables 4 and 5 indicate
that lakefront property owners are willing to
pay, on average, more than $28,000 for a
property on a lake free of milfoil, all else
equal (depending on specification, results
range from $28,000 to $32,087). (p 407)
With thenonlinear model, the estimated marginal
willingness-to-pay depends on the value of
the other exogenous variables, and the
average varies across milfoil lakes from a
low of approximately $13,700 to a high of
$48,400.29 (p 407)
This amounts to approximately 8% of
total property value, or 13% of total land
value, net of the value of any structure. 
we can calculate theaverage annual marginal willingness to pay
as approximately $1,400 (assuming a 5% discount
rate). Multiplying the average marginal
willingness to pay by the number of affected
parcels on the average lake, we arrive at an
aggregate cost of milfoil of about $187,600/
year, on average, for one additional infested

challenge ecological restoration globally. Ecological monitoring of restoration
is typically short term and rarely reassessed to determine if initial findings are
indicative of multiyear outcomes, and economic costs of restoration are seldom
quantified. To address these knowledge gaps, we resampled a restoration experiment
in an invasive Megathyrsus maximus – dominated ecosystem in Hawai‘i
to compare success of restoration treatments at 8 and 36 months. We calculated
cost to establish and maintain (for 3 yr) experimental field trials (0.13 ha)
and management-scale (1 ha and 10 ha) units, estimated 30-yr costs for
management-
scale units, and determined key drivers of costs. Survival of native
outplant species did not differ between 8- (56%) and 36-month (51%) monitoring
periods, and M. maximus cover was lower in restoration treatments than in
control plots at both time periods. Cost to establish and maintain the experimental
trial was $14,299 (Present Value at 2% annual discount rate, 2015 US$;
$109,993 ha−1). Scaling up restoration to 1 and 10 ha units produced economies
of scale, with 3 yr costs declining with increasing area ($149,918 ha−1 for 1 ha;
$124,139 ha−1 for 10 ha). Total Present Value to restore and maintain a 1 ha site
for 30 yr ranged from $153,195 to $302,917 ha−1, varying primarily based on
labor and seedling costs. This study demonstrates that early restoration results
can be indicative of longer-term results, establishment expenses drive long-term
costs, and restoration efforts are most cost-effective when maintained over large
spatial scales and long time periods. Importantly, this study allows other projects
in the region to estimate restoration costs based on site-specific criteria.",EN,,,2010,2013,Environment,Mixed_costs,Unit

However, the costs and benefits of using sentinel chickens in noncommercial operations are in question. The objective of this study was to use sentinel chickens to evaluate whether adequate cleaning and disinfection coupled with an appropriate time period without susceptible poultry species on the premises would eliminate END virus from a noncommercial poultry operation and preclude the need for placement of sentinels in previously infected operations before declaring them free of virus. Noncommercial poultry operations were selected from the 2002 to 2003 END outbreak database. Operations included in the study had one or more isolations of END virus (ENDV) from cloacal or oropharyngeal swabs of birds on the premises. A total of 546 birds were placed on 53 premises. All sentinel birds sampled after placements were negative by virus detection methods and serologic tests. Results of this study indicate that time and the application of appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures will adequately mitigate the risk of viable virus persisting in noncommercial poultry operations. In the future, this information may eliminate the need for sentinel bird placement to ensure virus free status of premises before repopulation, thereby decreasing the costs of END eradication.",EN,,,2002,2003,Authorities-Stakeholders,Mixed_costs,Site

Bioeconomics show promise in determining the optimal approach to managing weed invasions, notwithstanding ongoing difficulties in estimating the costs and benefits of eradication and alternative invasion management strategies. A flexible approach to the management of weed invasions is needed, allowing for the adoption of another strategy when it becomes clear that the probability of eradication is low, owing to resourcing or intractable technical issues. Whether the considerable progress that has been achieved towards eradication of the once massive witchweed invasion can be duplicated for other weeds of agricultural systems will depend to a large extent upon investment (. $250 million over 50 yr in this instance). Weeds of natural ecosystems seem destined to remain more difficult eradication targets for a variety of reasons, including higher impedance to eradication, more difficulty in valuing the benefits arising from eradication, and possibly less willingness to pay from society at large.",EN,,,2005,2009,Authorities-Stakeholders,Mixed_costs,Unit

Up to this date, no cure for it is known and the low profitability of the production forces growers to withdraw their crops. Therefore, the productive reconversion modifies the produc- tion pattern by establishing alternate crops with a higher agronomic and social feasibility, as well as a better economic profitability. The main goal of this research was to quantify the changes in the crops and to assess the potential of introducing new ones. In order to monitor, identify and quantify such changes, satellite imagery analysis, building and analysis of agricultural databases, on site measure- ments and interviews were conducted. An increasing number of crops were substituted, close to 5,000 ha of citrus have been replaced, which amounts to a reduction of 84,721 tons in the production of Mexican lemon and a loss of $302, 636,729 MXN, approximately.

Bell, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, personal communication).""",no,Nigel Taylor,N,trees,NA,NA,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L.)) is a native insect of Eurasia where it feeds on the leaves of broadleaf trees, especially oaks (Quercus spp.). Populations of gypsy moth increase periodically to very high local densities and severely defoliate preferred host trees (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990). In its native range, gypsy moth displays highly variable biological characteristics. The most significant life-history variations relevant to invasiveness are the geographic differences in flight capability of adult females and host food range of the larvae. Female moths from western (European) populations are flightless, while those from eastern (Asian) populations are capable of strong, directed flight. Gypsy moth larvae feed on a wide variety of mostly broadleaf tree hosts throughout their geographic range, but Asian populations also feed on coniferous tree species and therefore are of even greater concern to Canada than the European populations.
A European strain of the gypsy moth escaped from a laboratory near Boston, MA, in 1869. Since then, gypsy moth has spread and become established in the temperate forests of eastern North America, approximately between latitudes 36¬∞ and 47¬∞N, and from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes basin as far as 90¬∞W. During this same period, there have been repeated interceptions of both European and Asian strains of gypsy moth in western North America but, as yet (2000), neither strain is regarded as established there.
The North American experience with gypsy moth is an instructive case study of an invasive spe cies. There has been a well-documented public and scientific response to the problems caused by gypsy moth that can serve as a historical lesson for managing local and national environments in the global village. Scientific information on gypsy moth is probably as thorough as that on any invasive forest insect. Public policy on managing gypsy moth has ranged from neglect to aggressive mitigative action at considerable public cost and sometimes with dire environmental conse quences.
We can compare actions in the United States and Canada from distinct historical and legislative perspectives. As a case study in Canada, we can examine the impacts of establishment and spread of this alien species in eastern Canada and analyze the feasibility and benefits of maintaining gypsy moth-free regions by coordinating national and regional management activities. Discussion here emphasizes history and status of the European strain of gypsy moth now widely established in eastern North America and threatening to extend its range. Regulatory agencies now refer to this European strain as the North American gypsy moth, although it remains an alien species. Issues discussed here, however, pertain equally to the Asian strain of gypsy moth.
Attributes of an Invader
The gypsy moth has several biological and ecological attributes that favor its success as an invasive
species. Gypsy moth has a broad native geographic range that presents many potential sources of introduction. Also, the insect tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and feeds on many different tree species. Thus gypsy moth has a high probability of persistence in temperate forests worldwide. The reproductive biology of gypsy moth also favors colonization. Adult females may produce more than 1000 offspring in a single egg mass, so even one female can contribute a sizable founding population.
The greatest limitation of gypsy moth as an invasive species is that it is a poor disperser over long distances. The female adult moth of the European strain is flightless. Natural dispersal is restricted to relatively short distance ballooning of newly hatched larvae (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990), making gypsy moth‚Äôs surreptitious association with humans significant. Many of the host plants that gypsy moth favors flourish in habitats associated with human settlement. Further, gypsy moths frequently leave their host plants to lay eggs in sheltered locations and these are often structures associated with humans, such as firewood and outdoor household goods. When these goods are moved, the gypsy moth moves with them. Thus, although some spread of gypsy moth along the margins of its range in North America can be accounted for by natural dispersal of small larvae, inadvertent movement of egg masses, by a mobile human population, is the source of most new infestations in areas remote from the established populations, particularly those in western North America.

The cost of research and monitoring including salaries are extra and difficult to obtain reliably from the accounting methods used.""",no,Nigel Taylor,Y,south Vancouver Island,NA,NA,"[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L.)) is a native insect of Eurasia where it feeds on the leaves of broadleaf trees, especially oaks (Quercus spp.). Populations of gypsy moth increase periodically to very high local densities and severely defoliate preferred host trees (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990). In its native range, gypsy moth displays highly variable biological characteristics. The most significant life-history variations relevant to invasiveness are the geographic differences in flight capability of adult females and host food range of the larvae. Female moths from western (European) populations are flightless, while those from eastern (Asian) populations are capable of strong, directed flight. Gypsy moth larvae feed on a wide variety of mostly broadleaf tree hosts throughout their geographic range, but Asian populations also feed on coniferous tree species and therefore are of even greater concern to Canada than the European populations.
A European strain of the gypsy moth escaped from a laboratory near Boston, MA, in 1869. Since then, gypsy moth has spread and become established in the temperate forests of eastern North America, approximately between latitudes 36¬∞ and 47¬∞N, and from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes basin as far as 90¬∞W. During this same period, there have been repeated interceptions of both European and Asian strains of gypsy moth in western North America but, as yet (2000), neither strain is regarded as established there.
The North American experience with gypsy moth is an instructive case study of an invasive spe cies. There has been a well-documented public and scientific response to the problems caused by gypsy moth that can serve as a historical lesson for managing local and national environments in the global village. Scientific information on gypsy moth is probably as thorough as that on any invasive forest insect. Public policy on managing gypsy moth has ranged from neglect to aggressive mitigative action at considerable public cost and sometimes with dire environmental conse quences.
We can compare actions in the United States and Canada from distinct historical and legislative perspectives. As a case study in Canada, we can examine the impacts of establishment and spread of this alien species in eastern Canada and analyze the feasibility and benefits of maintaining gypsy moth-free regions by coordinating national and regional management activities. Discussion here emphasizes history and status of the European strain of gypsy moth now widely established in eastern North America and threatening to extend its range. Regulatory agencies now refer to this European strain as the North American gypsy moth, although it remains an alien species. Issues discussed here, however, pertain equally to the Asian strain of gypsy moth.
Attributes of an Invader
The gypsy moth has several biological and ecological attributes that favor its success as an invasive
species. Gypsy moth has a broad native geographic range that presents many potential sources of introduction. Also, the insect tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and feeds on many different tree species. Thus gypsy moth has a high probability of persistence in temperate forests worldwide. The reproductive biology of gypsy moth also favors colonization. Adult females may produce more than 1000 offspring in a single egg mass, so even one female can contribute a sizable founding population.
The greatest limitation of gypsy moth as an invasive species is that it is a poor disperser over long distances. The female adult moth of the European strain is flightless. Natural dispersal is restricted to relatively short distance ballooning of newly hatched larvae (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990), making gypsy moth‚Äôs surreptitious association with humans significant. Many of the host plants that gypsy moth favors flourish in habitats associated with human settlement. Further, gypsy moths frequently leave their host plants to lay eggs in sheltered locations and these are often structures associated with humans, such as firewood and outdoor household goods. When these goods are moved, the gypsy moth moves with them. Thus, although some spread of gypsy moth along the margins of its range in North America can be accounted for by natural dispersal of small larvae, inadvertent movement of egg masses, by a mobile human population, is the source of most new infestations in areas remote from the established populations, particularly those in western North America.

Populations of gypsy moth increase periodically to very high local densities and severely defoliate preferred host trees (Elkinton and Liebhold 1990). In its native range, gypsy moth displays highly variable biological characteristics. The most significant life-history variations relevant to invasiveness are the geographic differences in flight capability of adult females and host food range of the larvae. Female moths from western (European) populations are flightless, while those from eastern (Asian) populations are capable of strong, directed flight. Gypsy moth larvae feed on a wide variety of mostly broadleaf tree hosts throughout their geographic range, but Asian populations also feed on coniferous tree species and therefore are of even greater concern to Canada than the European populations.
A European strain of the gypsy moth escaped from a laboratory near Boston, MA, in 1869. Since then, gypsy moth has spread and become established in the temperate forests of eastern North America, approximately between latitudes 36¬∞ and 47¬∞N, and from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes basin as far as 90¬∞W.

Attributes of an Invader
The gypsy moth has several biological and ecological attributes that favor its success as an invasive
species. Gypsy moth has a broad native geographic range that presents many potential sources of introduction. Also, the insect tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions and feeds on many different tree species. Thus gypsy moth has a high probability of persistence in temperate forests worldwide. The reproductive biology of gypsy moth also favors colonization. Adult females may produce more than 1000 offspring in a single egg mass, so even one female can contribute a sizable founding population.
The greatest limitation of gypsy moth as an invasive species is that it is a poor disperser over long distances. The female adult moth of the European strain is flightless.

Plant quarantine pests are invasive alien pests that are capable of causing economic damage to agricultural crops or forest trees. These pests, which are classified as either absent or of restricted distribution in Canada, are controlled by the application of specific regulations aimed at preventing their artificial spread by human means (FAO 1999). Included in the classification are insects, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses, and weeds; to date, weeds have not been subjected to quarantine actions.

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada‚Äôs Land Base Resources
Each year Canada‚Äôs agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2). Damage resulting from past introductions of harmful invasive plant pests is currently estimated to be $7.3 billion annually (Table 1). Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Agriculture
A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species. Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa K√ºhn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe). Golden nematode is a major pest of potatoes in cool-temperate regions; it attacks the roots of the potato plants, causing thefoliage to yellow, wilt, and die. The oriental fruit moth‚Ä¶
